Release Notes for Saxon-HE 9.2
==============================

Saxon-HE (home edition) replaces Saxon-B as the open source version of the Saxon XSLT and XQuery processor.

Saxon-HE 9.2.1.5 is the latest maintenance release of Saxon-HE 9.2. It is available for both the Java 
and .NET platforms.

For the Java platform, download file saxonhe9-2-1-5j.zip

For the .NET platform, download file saxonhe9-2-1-5n.zip

The file saxon-resources9-2-0-2.zip contains documentation, sample files, test drivers and other
miscellaneous resources. It is common to both platforms. It also includes source code for the original
release 9.2.0.2; for the current maintenance release, an updated copy of the source code is available
in file saxon9-2-1-2source.zip. Source code (including latest patches) is also available via Subversion.

Release 9.2.1.1 (26 April 2010)
-------------------------------

The version number has been incremented from 9.2.0.x to 9.2.1.x because as well as patching Saxon bugs, 
this version includes build changes. These affect the .NET platform only.

Specifically, Saxon 9.2.1.1 uses IKVM 0.42.0.3, whereas earlier releases used a Saxon-specific build of 
IKVM numbered 0.40.0.2. The main reason for this is that the IKVM.OpenJDKDLLs in the 0.40.0.2 contained
unsatisfied dependencies on DLLs that were not included in the build. The calls giving rise to these dependencies
are never executed, but there are some environments where unsatisfied dependencies give rise to failures
even if this is the case. With the new build, it is still the case that there are references to DLLs not
included in the standard download; but on the rare occasions where this causes difficulties, the problem
can be solved by downloading the IKVM runtime directly from here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ikvm/files/ikvm/0.42.0.3/ikvmbin-0.42.0.3.zip/download

In addition to this change, the following bugs are fixed (see the bugs tracker on SourceForge for details):

 2988790 	current() used in xsl:number/@count: Internal error  
 2986685 	Inconsistent NamePool not detected in XPath API
 2986420 	Spurious XUST0001 when XQuery Update used with tracing 
 2986125 	mode="#current" within a function
 2986119 	Spurious error XTRE1500 (Write and read same document) 
 2984604 	DOMSource wrapping element with redefined namespace 
 2984409 	Compiling stylesheets for Saxon-HE
 2984037 	Saxon on .NET only reports first validation error 
 2982680 	Update with no-inherit loses too many namespaces 
 2982015 	current() used in predicates in a union pattern 
 2980277 	xsl:value-of generates multiple text nodes
 2974433 	Parsing errors in saxon:parse not sent to ErrorListener  
 2972578 	Formatting very small negative numbers
 2972519 	Validation against schema-for-schemas
 2970599 	Literal text nodes in stylesheet not traced
 2967055 	xs:decimal('-.0') fails
 2961611 	NPE during schema processing with xs:dayTimeDuration 
 2959570 	ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception in TinyTree
 2956660 	Configuration file passed to Validate command is rejected
 2956607 	rename creates duplicate namespace declarations
 2956558 	rename gives spurious error: conflicting namespace

Release 9.2.0.2 (5 August 2009)
------------------------------- 

9.2.0.2 was the first publicly-available build of Saxon 9.2. (Version 9.2.0.1 was a beta release made
available to selected users). 

Saxon-HE is not 100% backwards compatible with Saxon-B. Some advanced features have been dropped. These
include most notably:

* All Saxon extension functions and extension elements (including the SQL extension)

* The ability to call Java methods "reflexively" by dynamic loading (but a new mechanism for
  "integrated extension functions" is available in its place.
  
Users requiring these facilities should either upgrade to the commercial Saxon-PE (professional edition)
product available from http://www.saxonica.com/, or stick with the last release of Saxon-B,
namely Saxon-B 9.1.0.8. There are no plans to upgrade or maintain Saxon-B, but it will remain available
on SourceForge indefinitely.
