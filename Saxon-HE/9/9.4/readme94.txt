==============================

Saxon-HE 9.4 is the latest major release of the open-source edition of Saxon. 
It is available for both the Java and .NET platforms.

The current maintenance release is Saxon-HE 9.4.0.9.

The documentation for Saxon is at http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/
and includes a detailed list of changes for each release.

For the Java platform, download file SaxonHE9-4-0-9J.zip. Installation instructions are at
http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/about/installationjava.xml

For the .NET platform, download file SaxonHE9-4-0-9N-setup.exe. 
Installation instructions are at http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/about/installationdotnet.xml

The file saxon-resources9-4.zip contains documentation, sample files, test drivers and other miscellaneous resources. 
It is common to both platforms, and is not normally updated when new maintenance releases appear.

The file saxon9-4-0-9source.zip contains source code for both platforms; a new version is produced with each 
maintenance release. Source code with the latest patches can also be obtained from a Subversion repository
maintained at http://dev.saxonica.com/archive/opensource. The Subversion repository on the SourceForge
site is no longer maintained.

An incorrect build of 9.4.0.3 was uploaded on 2012-02-27; it was incorrect in that it did not incorporate all
the above fixes. This build was replaced in-situ on 2012-02-28. The two builds have the same version number, but
can be distinguished by the result of Version.getReleaseDate().

The following bugs are cleared in 9.4.0.2, issued 2012-01-20 (this includes bugs that appear only in the commercial
versions of the product). Bugs are listed under their old SourceForge numbers:

 3476703 	xs:openContent / xs:any / @maxOccurs 
 3476096 	Failing function not properly named in error Message 
 3474854 	Update Expressions: Not Inlining of variable in FLWOR 
 3474341 	NPE after copying extension function call 
 3473810 	Unicode surrogate pairs 	
 3473561 	AssertionError for shared append expression 
 3473555 	XPath setAllowUndeclaredVariables()
 3473031 	NPE after reporting XSLT compilation errors 
 3471840 	IllegalArgumentException in StringToUntypedAtomicCompiler

 3466144 	Only one window notified at end of sequence 
 3466143 	Tail calls and FLWOR expressions 
 3466125 	Tail calls and FLWOR expressions 
 3464429 	position variable incorrectly removed in ForClause 
 3463028 	XQuery 3.0 window clause: left paren after 'when'
 3462928 	Cannot cast CompiledExpression to VariableReference 
 3462497 	Inadequate XQuery tracing 
 3462473 	xsl:template entry missing in -T output 
 3462470 	XSLT Trace output displays text nodes wrongly 
 3460053 	With bytecode generation, no stack trace produced
 3459776 	Validation adding namespaced attribute using SCM
 3459503 	Failing to display byte code for certain inner classes 
 3459500 	Bytecode generation failure of filter expression

In addition there are two changes in the way the product is built in 9.4.0.2:

(a) on .NET, the version of IKVM used is 0.46.0.2. This clears a bug in
bytecode verification that affected Saxon.

(b) in Saxon-EE, the classes making up the ASM bytecode library are now renamed
into com.saxonica packages. This avoids conflicts when Saxon is used with an
application that has a dependency on a different version of the ASM library.



The first release in this series, 9.4.0.1, was issued on 9 December 2011. Release 9.4.0.1 fixes all bugs logged in the 
SourceForge bug tracker dated earlier than 9 December 2011.
