# Saxon Archive

This repository is an archive of older releases and projects of perhaps
historical interest. Nothing in this archive is being actively maintained.

Current releases of Saxon HE are available from the
[Saxon-HE repository](https://github.com/saxonica/Saxon-HE).
Current releases of other editions of Saxon and other Saxonica
products are available from
[Saxonica.com](https://saxonica.com/download/download_page.xml)

The directory sourceforge_website contains a snapshot of the SourceForge web pages as at 13 January 2023. These primarily contain documentation of releases from 6.4 to 7.9.1. 

(From 8.0, documentation moved to the Saxonica web site. Prior to 6.4, the information is not available online.)
