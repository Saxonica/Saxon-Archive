<p><b>Saxon 7.9.1 updates 7.9 with several bug fixes.</b></p>

<p>Release 7.9 is the latest installment of my progressive implementation of the new
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20">XPath 2.0</a>, 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20">XSLT 2.0</a>, and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery">XQuery 1.0</a> specifications. 

<p>The product is aligned with the working drafts published on 12 November 2003,
though a few features are not yet implemented. This version is designed to act as a basic
(non-schema-aware) XSLT and XQuery processor. A schema-aware version of the product is planned:
this will be a commercial product available from <a href="http://www.saxonica.com">Saxonica Limited</a>.</p>


<p>As always, changes are listed in <a href="changes.html">changes.html</a></p> 

<p>Saxon 7.x is now used for production applications by many users. The code is proving
stable and reliable. However, you need to be aware that the specifications are still
subject to change, and that new Saxon releases will track the changing specifications
with no concessions to backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>If you are looking for complete stability, 
the preferred version for production use is
<a href="http://saxon.sf.net/saxon6.5.3/">Saxon 6.5.3</a>, which
implements XSLT 1.0 and XPath 1.0.</p>

<p>Saxon 7.9 appears to be around 25% faster than Saxon 6.5.2, though the
results vary widely for different stylesheets.</p>

<p><b>Saxon 7.9 requires Java JDK 1.4</b></p>

<div style="border: solid thin; background-color: lime; padding: 1em">
<i>I now use the IDEA development
environment from <a href="http://www.intellij.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> for Saxon development. Many thanks
to IntelliJ for sponsoring this, and I can thoroughly recommend the product.</i>

<a NAME="Scope">

<h2>What is Saxon?</h2>
</a>

<p>The Saxon package is a collection of tools for processing XML documents. The main components
are: </p>

<ul>
<li>An XSLT 2.0 processor, which implements the 
Version 2.0 XSLT and XPath Recommendations from the World Wide Web Consortium, found at
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">
http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20</a> and
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">
http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20</a>
with a number of powerful extensions.</code>.</li>

<li>An XPath 2.0 processor accessible via an API to Java applications.</li>

<li>An XQuery 1.0 processor that can be used from the command line, or invoked from
a Java application by use of an API.</li>

</ul>

<p>So you can use Saxon by writing XSLT stylesheets, by writing XQuery queries
by writing Java applications, or by combinations of the approaches.</p>

<p>Saxon implements the XSLT 1.0 recommendation, including XPath 1.0, in its entirety.
Saxon 7.x also implements most of the features defined in the XSLT 2.0, XPath 2.0, and XQuery 1.0
working drafts, in particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for multiple output files using <code>xsl:result-document</code></li>

  <li>Full processing capability on temporary trees (previously known as result tree
  fragments)</li>
  
  <li>Support for sequences of nodes and simple values</li>
  
  <li>Grouping facilities</li>
  
  <li>Regular expression processing</li>
  
  <li>Support for the new XPath expressions <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, 
  <code>some</code> and <code>every</code></li>
  
  <li>Support for named collating sequences</li>
  
  <li>Many new functions and operators</li>
  
  <li>Support for new data types, such as dates, times, and durations</li>
  
</ul>

<p>Saxon does not yet implement all of XSLT 2.0, XPath 2.0, or XQuery 1.0. The most notable
omission is support for XML Schema data typing. Most of the important built-in types are supported,
but not user-defined types. Development of a schema-aware version of Saxon is well advanced;
this will be available as a commercial product from <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/">Saxonica Limited</a>.</p> 

<p>In addition, Saxon provides an extensive library 
of <a href="extensions.html">extension elements and extension functions</a>,
 all implemented in conformance with the XSLT Recommendation to ensure that 
portable stylesheets can be written. These include the <a href="http://www.exslt.org/">EXSLT</a>
extension libraries <b>common</b>, <b>sets</b>, <b>math</b>, and <b>dates-and-times</b>.
Many of these extensions were pioneered in Saxon and have since become available
in other products.</p>

<p><i>These functions are in general accessible from XQuery as well as XSLT,
except where they depend on stylesheet information.</i></p>

<p>Saxon also provides an API allowing a Java application to execute XPath and XQuery expressions and
process the results. The XPath API is modelled on the proposed DOM Level 3 API, but adapted to the
requirements of XPath 2.0. A separate API is available for XQuery 1.0, reflecting differences in the
way the context is set up.</p>

<h2><a NAME="Historical">Historical Note</a></h2>

<p>Saxon is essentially a one-man project: I have done almost all the development myself,
except for a small number of routines which I "borrowed" from other open source products,
and a few add-ons contributed by users.</p>

<p>I originally wrote Saxon to support an internal project in <a HREF="http://www.icl.com">ICL</a>,
and ICL continued to sponsor development of Saxon until my departure from the company 
in January 2001. However, it was never a supported ICL product. From 2001 through 2003 I worked
for <a href="http://www.softwareag.com">Software AG</a>, who continued
to sponsor the development of Saxon as an open source product.</p>

<p>In March 2004 I founded <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/">Saxonica Limited</a> to provide
ongoing development and support of Saxon as a commercial venture. My intent is to continue to
produce the basic (non-schema-aware) version of Saxon as an open source product, while at the same
time delivering professional services and additional modules (including a schema-aware processor)
as commercial offerings.</p>

<p>This version of Saxon is available entirely without support or warranty, and with
no commitments to any future releases.</p>

<p>The name Saxon was chosen because originally it was a layer on top of SAX. Also, it originally used
the Ælfred parser (among others); Ælfred of course was a Saxon king...</p>

<hr>
<p>Please read the <a href="conditions.html">Conditions of Use</a>.</p>

<hr>
<a NAME="Support"><h2>Technical Support</h2></a>

<p>Saxon comes with no warranty and no formal technical support service.</p>

<p>If you have questions, however, you can usually get an answer by raising them on the Saxon
discussion list at <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help</a>.</p>

<p>Once registered, you can post messages to <a href="mailto:saxon-help@lists.sourceforge.net">saxon-help@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

<p>If you hit something that looks like a bug, please check the known errors on
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon">the Saxon project pages at SourceForge</a>.
Also check the list archives.</p>

<p>If the query relates to the XSLT/XPath language rather than Saxon itself, it is better to use
 the <a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/xsl/xsl-list/">XSL-list</a>: check first that the query
 isn't already covered in the FAQ. Other useful sites for XSLT information are
 <a href="http://www.xslt.com/">www.xslt.com</a>, 
 <a href="http://www.xmlsoftware.com">www.xmlsoftware.com</a> and
  <a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/">www.jenitennison.com</a>.</p>
  
<p>Help forums for XQuery are less active at the moment, for details see the
XQuery home page at <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query">http://www.w3.org/XML/Query</a></p>

<hr>

<A name="Installation"><h2>Installation</h2></a>

<p><span class="highlight">Please see the file <a href="changes.html">changes.html</a> for
details of all changes in this release.</span></p>

<p>The full Saxon distribution includes source and object code,
 documentation, and <a HREF="samples.html">sample applications</a>.</p>
 
<p>To install the product, all you need to do is to unzip the supplied distribution file into a suitable
directory.</p>

<p>Saxon can be used either from the command line, or from a Java application, using the
JAXP 1.2 API which is included as a standard feature of JDK 1.4. 
Object code is issued as a JAR file, <b>saxon7.jar</b>, which you must include on your class path.

<p>Saxon no longer includes a built-in XML parser: by default it uses the XML parser supplied with
the Java VM. But you can use it with a different XML
parser if you wish. To do this from the command line, specify the required parser using the
-x or -y options; from the Java API, set the name of the parser class as an attribute of
the TransformerFactory object.</p>

<p>User documentation, covering both the XSLT and Java interfaces, is included in the download in the form
 of extensive <code>javadoc</code> specifications. Be sure to read the package summaries, which give an overview
 in the form of a user guide.
In addition there is an <a href="api-guide.html">introductory overview</a>.</p>


<h3>Prerequisites</b>:</h3>

<p>The following software must be installed separately, it is not included with the Saxon download.</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Java development environment. Saxon 7.9 requires JDK 1.4; this
  means it will no longer work with the Microsoft Java VM.</li>
    
  <li>Saxon has an option to work with a source tree constructed using
   <a href="http://www.jdom.org/">JDOM</a>. Saxon 7.9 is validated with
   JDOM beta 10; it probably works with JDOM beta 9, but may not work with earlier releases.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Saxon has been tested successfully in the past with a wide variety of parsers including
 Xerces, Lark, SUN Project X, Crimson, Piccolo, Oracle XML, xerces, xml4j, and xp. Use of a SAX2-compliant
 parser is now mandatory. All the relevant classes must be installed on your Java CLASSPATH.</p>
 
<p>Saxon's DOM interface has been tested with the Crimson parser included as standard in
Sun's JDK 1.4 platform and with the Xerces 2.5.0 DOM implementation.</p>
 
<p>Because Saxon is run from the command line, you might find it useful (under Microsoft Windows)
 to have a text editor
with better command-line support than the standard DOS window. I use <a href="http://www.jedit.org">jEdit</a>, 
which is an open source product with a wide-selection of optional plug-ins.</p>
