<h2><a name="xslt-xpath-10">XSLT 1.0 and XPath 1.0 conformance</a></h2>

<p><i>Saxon XSLT implements the
XSLT 1.0 and XPath 1.0 Recommendations from the World Wide Web Consortium, found at
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">
http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt</a> and
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">
http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath</a>, which are 
referred to here collectively as "XSLT"</i></p>

<p>Saxon is 100% conformant to the mandatory requirements of these recommendations,
except in some cases where incompatibilities have been introduced in the
XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0 working drafts.</p>

<h2><a name="xslt20">XSLT 2.0 conformance</a></h2>

<p>This release of Saxon
implements many facilities defined in the draft XSLT 2.0 specification. This implementation
is not yet complete, though most features defined in the working draft of 12 November 2003 are available.</p>

<p>This version of Saxon acts as a <i>Basic XSLT Processor</i>
 (as distinct from a <i>Schema-Aware XSLT Processor</i>). This means it does not allow schemas
 to be imported and does not support validation of source or result documents or reference
 to user-defined types.</p>

<p>Known restrictions, relative to the conformance rules for a basic XSLT processor,
include the following:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The new <code>xsl:output</code> option  <code>normalize-unicode</code>
is not implemented.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>xhtml</code> output method does not follow all the rules for XHTML formatting in
the draft XSLT 2.0 specification.</p></li>

<li><p>If <code>key()</code> is called in a match pattern, the argument must be a string literal.</p></li>

<li><p>The semantics of patterns when applied to nodes in non-document trees are not yet properly
implemented.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>xsl:perform-sort</code> element must currently have a <code>select</code> attribute and empty
content (apart from the xsl:sort elements themselves).</p></li>

<li><p>When the source document is supplied as a pre-built tree (in any format), Saxon strips whitespace
text nodes as requested by the stylesheet, but takes no account of any <code>xml:space</code>
 attributes present in the tree.</p></li>
 
<li><p>The ability for <code>xsl:key</code> and <code>xsl:sort</code> to contain a sequence
constructor is not implemented</p></li>

<li><p>The error codes defined in the specification are not used.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="xpath20">XPath 2.0 conformance</a></h2>

<p>This release of Saxon implements
the full XPath 2.0 grammar as defined in the working draft of 12 November 2003.</p> 

<p>The restrictions in XPath 2.0 support include the following:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Saxon supports all the built-in data types with the exception of xs:NOTATION.</p></li>

<li><p>The data type xs:unsignedLong is constrained to fit in 63 bits.</p></li>

<li><p>Casting of a string to a QName is not supported, except when an explicit
cast or constructor function is used in an XSLT environment.</p></li>

<li><p>The state of implementation of all the standard functions is described in
<a href="functions.html">functions.html</a></p></li> 

<li><p>Support for the type <code>xs:duration</code> goes beyond what the specification allows.
Ordering is implemented as a total order over all durations, based on the average length of a month
(one year = 365.242199 days).</p> </li>

<li><p>The error codes defined in the specification are not used.</p></li>
</ul>
 

</ul>

<h2><a name="xquery">XQuery 1.0 Conformance</a></h2>

<p>The restrictions noted above with respect to XPath 2.0 apply equally to Saxon's support for
XQuery 1.0.</p>

<p>Additional restrictions in Saxon compared with the November 2003 draft of XQuery 1.0 include the
following:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>User-defined functions must have namespace-prefixed names.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>as</code> clause in variable declarations (both global variables, and <code>for</code>
and <code>let</code> variables) follow the function calling
rules, rather than the stricter rules that apply to variables. That is, the supplied value is converted to the declared
type in three ways: atomization of nodes, casting of untyped atomic, and numeric promotion.</p></li> 

<li><p>The <code>as</code> clause in <code>some</code> and <code>every</code> expressions is not
implemented.</p></li>

<li><p>Computed namespace constructors are not implemented.</p></li>

<li><p>The rules that determine which namespace nodes should be added to a constructed element
are not fully implemented. (The main exception is that in some cases, constructed nodes 
inherit the namespace of their new parent, which is wrong according to the spec.)</p></li>
</ul>



<h2><a name="other">Conformance with other specifications</a></h2>

<p>Saxon is dependant on the user-selected XML parser to ensure conformance with the XML 1.0
Recommendation and the XML Namespaces Recommendation.</p>

<p>Saxon implements the <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt;</code> processing instruction as described in the 
W3C Recommendation <i>Associating StyleSheets with XML Documents</i>.
The <b>href</b> pseudo-attribute must be a URI identifying an XML document containing a stylesheet,
or a URI with a fragment identifier identifying an embedded stylesheet. The fragment must be the value
of an ID attribute declared as such in the DTD.</p>

<p>Saxon works with any SAX2-conformant XML parser that is configured to enable namespace 
processing. There is one limitation: on the startElement() call from the XMLReader to the
ContentHandler, the QName (that is, the third argument) must be present. According to the SAX2
specification, namespace-aware parsers are not obliged to supply this argument. However, all
commonly-used parsers appear to do so.</p>

<p>Saxon should work with any DOM-conformant XML parser, however, Saxon's DOM interface is tested
only with Crimson and Xerces, and DOM implementations are known to vary widely.</p>

<p>When a DOM or JDOM tree is supplied as the transformation input, Saxon does not combine adjacent
text nodes into a single node. Adjacent text nodes can occur as the result of user modifications to the
tree, or as a result of the presence of CDATA sections or entity references, depending on the options
in force when the tree was constructed.</p>

<p>When a DOM or JDOM tree is supplied as the transformation input, Saxon does not take the <code>xml:space</code>
attribute into consideration when deciding whether or not to strip whitespace text nodes.</p>


<hr>


<h3><a name="documentation">Conformance Documentation</a></h3>

<p>The XSLT specification says that the documentation for an implementation should specify
which URI schemes
are supported. Saxon supports the URI scheme implemented by the Java <code>java.net.URL</code> class, with
the optional addition of a fragment identifier, as described below. 
Additionally,
Saxon allows the user to nominate a URIResolver class which can be used to implement any URI scheme
the user wants.</p>

<p>The XSLT specification says that the documentation for an implementation should specify for which
media types fragment identifiers are supported. The standard URI resolver supports access to 
XML documents 
only. A simple fragment identifier is allowed, consisting of the value of an ID attribute in the
document. The effect is to return the subdocument rooted at the element with this identifier if there
is one, or an empty document otherwise. For example, the URI mydoc.xml#aaa locates the XML document
mydoc.xml, and if it contains an element &lt;eeee id="aaa"&gt;, where id is an attribute of type ID, then
the document retrieved is an XML document with this &lt;eeee&gt; element as its outermost (document) 
element.</p>

<p>The values of the vendor-specific system properties are:</p>

<table>
<tr><td width="120">xsl:version</td><td>2.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>xsl:vendor</td><td>SAXON n.n.n from Saxonica</td></tr>
<tr><td>xsl:vendor-url</td><td>http://saxon.sf.net/</td></tr>
<tr><td>xsl:product-name</td><td>SAXON</td></tr>
<tr><td>xsl:product-version</td><td>n.n.n</td></tr>
</table>

<p>All these values are subject to change in future releases. Users wishing to test whether the
processor is Saxon are advised to test whether the xsl:product system property has the value
"SAXON".</p>


<h3>Extensions</h3>

<p>Saxon implements a number of extensions to standard XSLT, following the rules for extension
functions and extension elements where appropriate. The extensions are documented in
<a href="extensions.html">extensions.html</a>. They are all implemented in accordance with
the provisions in the standard for extensibility.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name="encodings">Character Encodings Supported</a></h2>

<p>The encodings supported on input depend entirely on your choice of XML parser.</p>

<p>On output, any encoding supported by the Java VM may be used.</p>

<p>There are some differences between the character encodings supported by the old <code>java.io</code> package
and the new <code>java.nio</code> package. If the requested encoding is not supported by the <code>java.nio</code> package, then
all non-ASCII characters will be represented using numeric character references. If the encoding is
not supported by the <code>java.io</code> package, then Saxon will revert to using UTF-8 as the actual output
encoding. A list of the character encodings
supported in the <code>java.nio</code> package can be obtained by using the command <code>java net.sf.saxon.charcode.CharacterSetFactory</code>,
with no parameters.</p> 

<hr />

<h2><a name="collation-uri">Collation URIs</a></h2>

<p>Collations used for comparing strings can be specified by means of a URI. A collation URI may
be used as an argument to many of the <a href="functions.html">standard functions</a>, and 
also as an attribute of <code>xsl:sort</code> in XSLT, and in the <code>order by</code>
clause of a FLWOR expression in XQuery.</p>

<p>The W3C specifications leave the details of collation URIs entirely implementation-defined. This
section explains the collation URIs that can be used with Saxon.</p>

<p>In Saxon XSLT stylesheets, collations may be described using a <code>saxon:collation</code>
element as a top-level declaration in the stylesheet. In this case the value of the <code>name</code>
attribute of the <code>saxon:collation</code> may be used as a collation URI. There is no constraint
on the form this URI takes, indeed there is no requirement that it be a legal URI. 
See <a href="extensions.html#saxon:collation">saxon:collation</a> for more details.</p>

<p>A collation URI may also be constructed directly. This enables collation URIs to be used in
XPath and XQuery applications as well as in XSLT stylesheets. Such a collation URI takes the form
<code>http://saxon.sf.net/collation?keyword=value;keyword=value;...</code>. The query parameters
in the URI can be separated either by ampersands or semicolons, but semicolons are usually more
convenient. The keywords available are as follows:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><td><b>keyword</b></td><td><b>values</b></td><td><b>effect</b></td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<tr>
<td valign="top">class</td>
<td valign="top">fully-qualified Java class name of a class that
implements <code>java.util.Comparator</code>.</td>
<td valign="top">This parameter should not be combined with any other parameter.
An instance of the requested class is created, and is used to perform
the comparisons. Note that if the collation is to be used
in functions such as contains() and starts-with(), this class must also be a
<code>java.text.RuleBasedCollator</code>. This approach allows a user-defined collation
to be implemented in Java.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">lang</td>
<td valign="top">any value allowed for xml:lang, for example <code>en-US</code> for US English</td>
<td valign="top">This is used to find the collation appropriate to a Java locale. The collation
may be further tailored using the parameters <code>strength</code> and
<code>decomposition</code>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">strength</td>
<td valign="top">primary, secondary, tertiary, or identical</td>
<td valign="top">Indicates the differences that are considered significant when comparing
two strings. A/B is a primary difference; A/a is a secondary difference;
a/á is a tertiary difference (though this varies by language). So
if strength=primary then A=a is true; with strength=secondary 
then A=a is false but a=á is true; with strength=tertiary
then a=á is false.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">decomposition</td>
<td valign="top">none, standard, full</td>
<td valign="top">Indicates how the collator handles Unicode composed characters. See
the JDK documentation for details.</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>It is also possible to specify the Unicode Codepoint Collation defined in the
W3C specifications, currently <code>http://www.w3.org/2003/05/xpath-functions/collation/codepoint</code>.</p>

<p>In addition, the APIs provided for executing XPath and XQuery expressions allow named collations to
be registered by the calling application, as part of the static context.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name="jaxp">JAXP 1.2 Conformance</a></h2>

<p>Saxon implements the JAXP 1.2 API (originally known as TrAX), which is now documented as
a standard part of JDK 1.4.
Saxon implements the interfaces in the javax.xml.transform package in full, including support for
SAX, DOM, and Stream input, and SAX, DOM, and Stream output.</p>

<p><i>Note: The transformation interfaces in JAXP 1.2 are identical to JAXP 1.1: the new version
only affects the XML parser interface, adding options to control schema validation.</i></p> 

<p>Saxon also implements part of the javax.xml.parsers API. Saxon no longer provides its own SAX parser, 
however it does provide a DocumentBuilder.
The DOM interfaces are limited by the capabilities of the Saxon DOM, specifically the fact that
it is read-only. Nevertheless, the DocumentBuilder may be used to construct a Saxon tree, or to
obtain an empty Document node which can be supplied in a DOMResult to hold the result of a
transformation.</p>

<a name="errorrecovery"><h2>XSLT Error Recovery Policy</h2></a>

<p>Where the XSLT specification requires that an error be signaled, Saxon produces an error
message and terminates stylesheet execution. In the case of errors detected at compile
time, it attempts to report as many errors as possible before terminating; in the case
of run-time errors, it terminates after the first error.</p>

<p>Where the XSLT specification states that the processor may recover from an error, Saxon takes
one of three actions as described in the table below. Either it signals the error and terminates
execution, or it recovers silently from the error in the manner permitted by the specification,
or it places the action under user control. In the latter case there are three options: report the
error and terminate, recover silently, or (the default) recover after writing a warning
 to the system error output stream. These actions can be modified by supplying a user-defined
 ErrorListener.</p>

<p>Handling of individual recoverable errors is described in the table below.</p>

<p><i>This list is incomplete and needs to be reviewed.</i></p>

<table>
<tr><td><b>Error</b></td><td><b>Action</b></td></tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">There is more than one template rule that matches a node, with the
same import precedence and priority</td>
