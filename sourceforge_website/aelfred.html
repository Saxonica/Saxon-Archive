<p>This page describes the Saxon version of the &AElig;lfred XML Parser.</p>

<p>This was distributed
with releases of Saxon until Saxon version 7.1. Saxon versions from 7.2 onwards no longer include a built-in XML parser. This decision was
taken because Saxon is now dependent on JDK 1.4, which includes its own XML parser, and therefore
the original reason for bundling a parser with Saxon has disappeared.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the &AElig;lfred parser offered some advantages over the Crimson parser
included with JDK 1.4, and it is therefore now available as a free-standing download.</p>

<p>This version branched some while ago from the version developed by David Brownell (see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpathx/jaxp/apidoc/gnu/xml/aelfred2/package-summary.html">here</a>),
which is now packaged in the GNU XML library. David Brownell's version has added considerably
more functionality (such as validation) and has grown correspondingly larger.</p>

<p>The parser implements SAX2 and JAXP 1.1 parser interfaces. It has no DOM support, and no
support for validation: in fact, it is about as stripped-down as an XML parser can get.</p>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>Follow this link to <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/saxon/aelfred7_0.zip">download</a>
the software.</p>

<p>The download includes the JAR file <code>saxon-aelfred.jar</code>, a ZIP file containing the source code,
and this documentation.</p>

<h2>Technical Details</h2>

<p>The SAX2 interface is available through class <code>net.sf.saxon.aelfred.SAXDriver</code>, which
implements the interface <code>org.xml.sax.XMLReader</code>.</p>

<p>The JAXP 1.1 interface is available through class <code>net.sf.saxon.aelfred.SAXParserFactoryImpl</code>,
which implements the interface <code>javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory</code>.

<p>The SAX2 and JAXP libraries are not included in the package; these must be installed separately.
They are available automatically if you use JDK 1.4.</p>

<p>The package can be used independently of Saxon.</p>

<p>The JAR file includes no manifest, so placing the JAR file on your classpath will not make
this the default JAXP parser. To invoke this parser via JAXP, you must explicitly set the
system property <code>javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory</code> to the value
<code>net.sf.saxon.aelfred.SAXParserFactoryImpl</code>.</p>

<p>&AElig;lfred supports the following character encodings:</p>

<pre>
ISO-8859-1, 8859_1, ISO8859_1
US-ASCII, ASCII 
UTF-8, UTF8
ISO-10646-UCS-2, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE
</pre>

<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>

<p>&AElig;lfred was originally developed by David Megginson at Microstar (which no longer exists), and placed
more or less in the public domain.</p>

<p>This is a modified version of the &AElig;lfred XML parser from
Microstar. I have taken a few of David Brownell's updates, repackaged it,
  and fixed a few bugs. All cahnges are clearly documented in the source code.</p>

<p>The result is distributed under the terms of Microstar's original terms and conditions, 
which are as follows:</p>

<table><tr><td width=100></td><td>

<p>The version included with Saxon is David Brownell's code of 26 Feb 2000,
modified as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Changed the package name to net.sf.saxon.aelfred to prevent any accidental confusion with the
 original Microstar code or with David Brownell's version.</li>
<li>Fixed several bugs: (1) a bug in namespace handling (where an attribute xxx:name precedes the xmlns:xxx
 declaration) (2) poor diagnostics when end of file occurs prematurely </li>
<li>Subsetting the code to include only the XML non-validating parser and SAX driver, with appropriate
changes to the setFeature() and getFeature() methods.</li>
<li>Some further changes made by David Brownell up to June 2001 have been incorporated.</li>
</ul>
