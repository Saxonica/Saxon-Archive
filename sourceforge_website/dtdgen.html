<h1>A tool to generate XML DTDs</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>DTDGenerator is a program that takes an XML document as input and produces a Document
Type Definition (DTD) as output.</p>

<p>The aim of the program is to give you a quick start in writing a DTD. The DTD is one of
the many possible DTDs to which the input document conforms. Typically you will want to
examine the DTD and edit it to describe your intended documents more precisely.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#FF0080">The program was formerly issued as part of the
 <a HREF="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">Saxon</a> product.
It is now completely independent of Saxon, though it can still be downloaded
from the Saxon site.</font></strong></p>

<p>DTDGenerator runs as a SAX ContentHandler, and can be used with any
XML parser that implements the JAXP 1.1 interface: examples are Crimson and
Xerces from the Apache project, and the AElfred parser that is embedded in Saxon.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Web service</h3>

<p>You can use DTDGenerator without installing the software by submitting an XML file to
the online service provided by Paul Tchistopolskii at 
<a href="http://www.pault.com/Xmltube/dtdgen.html">http://www.pault.com/Xmltube/dtdgen.html</a>.</p>

<p>If you use this service, ensure that the XML file you upload contains no references to other
local files such as a DTD or an external entity.</p>

<p>Note: this service is currently using an older version of DTDGenerator, so it may 
produce a slightly different result from the current version.</p>

<h3>Software required</h3>

<p>DTDGenerator requires the following software to be installed:</p>

<ul>
<li>JRE 1.2 or later (that is, a Java VM that supports the JDK 1.2 class library, also
referred to as Java 2 Standard Edition). 
DTDGenerator will not run with earlier Java VMs, in particular, it will not run with
the Java VM issued by Microsoft as part of Internet Explorer.</li>
<li>A SAX2-compatible XML parser. DTDGenerator has been tested with Xerces, with Crimson,
and with the version of AElfred that is included in the Saxon distribution.</li>
<li>The API libraries for SAX2 and JAXP 1.1. All the above parsers include these API
libaries as embedded software, so if you use these parsers, no special action is needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The DTDGenerator code itself is issued as a JAR file, <code>dtdgen.jar</code>.</p>

<p>Ensure that all these components are on your classpath. The JAXP 1.1 mechanism ensures
that DTDGenerator will pick up any suitable XML parser automatically from the classpath;
if you want to choose a parser more specifically, you can do this by setting the system
property <code>javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory</code>.</p>

<p>From the command line, enter:</p>

<p><code><b>java DTDGenerator</b> <i>inputfile</i> &gt;<i>outputfile</i></p>

<p></code>The input file must be an XML document; typically it will have no DTD. If it
does have a DTD, the DTD may be used by the XML parser but it will be ignored by the
DTDGenerator utility.</p>

<p>The output file will be an XML external document type definition.</p>

<p>The input file is not modified; if you want to edit it to refer to the generated DTD,
you must do this yourself.</p>

<hr />

<h2>What DTDGenerator does</h2>

<p>The program makes an internal list of all the elements and attributes that appear in your
document, noting how they are nested, and noting which elements contain character data.</p>

<p>When the document has been completely processed, the DTD is generated according to the
following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If an element contains both non-space character data and child elements, then it is
    declared with mixed element content, permitting all child elements that are actually
    encountered within instances of that parent element.</li>
  <li>If no significant character data is found in an element, it is assumed that the element
    cannot contain character data.</li>
  <li>If an element contains child elements but no significant character data, then it is
    declared as having element content. If the same child elements occur in every instance
    of the parent and in a consistent sequence, then this sequence is reflected in the element
    declaration: where child elements are repeated or trailing children (only) are omitted
    in some instances of the parent element, this will result in a declaration that shows
    the child element as being repeatable or optional or both. If no such consistency of
    sequence can be detected, then a more general form of element
    declaration is used in which all child elements may appear any number of times in any 
    order.
  <li>If neither character data nor subordinate elements are found in an element, it is
    assumed the element must always be empty.</li>
  <li>An attribute appearing in an element is assumed to be REQUIRED if it appears in every
    occurrence of the element.</li>
  <li>An attribute that has a distinct value every time it appears is assumed to be an
    identifying (ID) attribute, provided that there are at least 10 and at most 100,000 
    instances of the element in the input document.</li>
  <li>An attribute is assumed to be an enumeration attribute if it has less than 20 distinct
    values, provided that the number of instances of the attribute is at least three times the
    number of distinct values and at least ten. </li>
</ul>

<p>The numeric constants used by these rules are defined in the source code; if you want
to change them, you can either edit and recompile the source code, or write a subclass
that uses different values.</p>

<h2>What DTDGenerator doesn't do</h2>

<p>The program makes no attempt to determine whether different elements or attributes
(that is, elements or attributes with different names) have the same structure. The
output DTD will never contain parameter entities to define such common structures.
This means that in documents that allow flexible rules on nesting (like the XHTML
structure, where any inline element can contain any other inline element), the DTD
will contain an unnecessary amount of redundancy.</p>

<p>DTDGenerator makes no attempt to recognize IDREF or IDREFS attributes, nor other
specialized attribute types such as ENTITY or ENTITIES.</p>

<p>DTDGenerator is not namespace-aware. The names of elements and attributes used
in the DTD are identical to the QNames used in the source document, and different
QNames are assumed to relate to different elements. Namespace declarations appearing
in the source document are treated as ordinary attributes, so they will be included in 
the output DTD.</p>

<p>DTDGenerator does not produce XML Schemas. There are various tools that allow a
DTD to be converted to a schema.</p>

<p>DTDGenerator works from a single input XML document. It makes no attempt to compare
the structure of multiple input documents. A technique that has been used successfully
is to concatenate multiple documents within a single wrapper element. This can be done
using XML entities, or by means of a SAX filter, or more simply by file concatenation at
the textual level (provided that the documents contain no prolog). 
On completion, simply delete the declaration of the wrapper element from
the generated DTD.</p>

<p>DTDGenerator does not produce any entity or notation declarations in the output DTD.</p>

<h2>Fine-tuning the resulting DTD</h2>

<p>The resulting DTD will often contain rules that are either too restrictive or too
liberal. The DTD may be too restrictive if it prohibits constructs that do not appear in
this document, but might legitimately appear in others. It may be too liberal if it fails
to detect patterns that are inherent to the structure: for example, the order of elements
within a parent element. These limitations are inherent in any attempt to infer general
rules from a particular example document.</p>

<p>In general, therefore, you will need to iterate the process. You have a choice: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Either edit the generated DTD to reflect your knowledge of the document type.</li>
  <li>Or edit the input document to provide a more representative sample of features that will
    be encountered in other document instances, and run the utility again.</li>
</ul>

<p>In a few unusual cases DTDGenerator will create a DTD which is invalid, or one to which
 the document does not conform.
You will then have to edit the DTD before you can use it. The known cases are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An attribute can only be declared as an ID if all its values are valid XML names,
   and as an enumeration type if all its values are valid XML NMTOKENs. DTDGenerator only makes a
   partial check against this condition: in particular, it only rejects values that contain
   ASCII characters that cannot appear in names (e.g. space).</li>
   
  <li>DTDGenerator will decide that an attribute is an ID attribute if all its values are
    distinct, without checking whether the set of values overlaps with those of another
    ID attribute. In some cases this results in an IDREF attribute being incorrectly classified
    as an ID.</li>
    
  <li>DTDGenerator writes the output DTD as a text file, with no XML declaration to define the
  encoding of the result file. The actual encoding of the file depends on the Java VM
  and the locale; it will not normally be UTF-8 or UTF-16, which are the encodings an XML parser
  expects in the absence of an XML declaration. 
  If the document uses element or attribute names containing non-ASCII
  characters, you may therefore need to add a text declaration
   at the start of the DTD to define the correct encoding.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>Because DTDGenerator is a pure SAX application, it should run almost as fast as the
underlying XML parser.</p>

<p>The memory requirements are very small. Most of the data structures increase linearly
either with the size of the DTD or with the depth of nesting of elements in the source document. The
only structure that grows linearly with the size of the source document is the list of unique
values encountered for an attribute, which is used to decide whether the attribute is an ID,
 and this is capped at a maximum of 100,000 values.</p>

<p>In an exercise carried out at Software AG, where the DTD was required as input
to the design study for a Tamino XML database, a 500Mb source XML file was processed in
a little over 6 minutes.</p>
