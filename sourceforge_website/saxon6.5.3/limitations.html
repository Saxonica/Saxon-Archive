Limitations</font></b></p>

<p>This page lists areas where Saxon 6.5.3 is known to be non-conformant with
W3C specifications.</p>

<p>Since Saxon 6.5.3 is now stable and generally reliable, I have no intention of
removing these limitations.</p>

<h2>XSLT 1.0 conformance</h2>


<ol>
<li><p>The characters used in the <code>xsl:decimal-format</code> element and the
picture string of <code>format-number</code> must have Unicode code points
less than 65535.</p></li>

<li><p>When Saxon is run with a Java version later than 1.1, the picture string of
<code>format-number</code> behaves as implemented in that version of the Java 
<code>DecimalFormat</code> class, whereas
the XSLT specification mandates that it should behave as specified in JDK 1.1.</p></li>

<li><p>The output of <code>generate-id</code> for an attribute or namespace node
may contain non-ASCII or non-alphanumeric characters if the name of the attribute
or namespace node contains such characters.</p></li>

<li><p>When the <code>version</code> attribute is set to <code>1.1</code>, Saxon
recognizes certain constructs that were defined in the draft XSLT 1.1 specification;
XSLT 1.0 requires that such constructs are treated as errors.</p></li>


<li><p>An erratum to the XSLT 1.0 specification states that <code>xsl:copy</code> and <code>xsl:copy-of</code>
may be used to add a namespace node to a newly constructed element. This works correctly in Saxon, provided
that the name of the namespace node does not clash with the namespace prefix that Saxon has allocated to the
element for serialization purposes. (In principle, this namespace prefix should not be present in the result
tree, and should therefore be incapable of causing a conflict.) More details: see bug 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=637117&group_id=29872&atid=397617">637117</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Saxon's checking of the characters used in a QName is an approximation to the rules in the XML specification.
Some rarely-used characters are permitted when they should be rejected, and there may also be a few cases where
valid characters are rejected.</p></li>


<li><p>When comparing two nodes for identity (e.g. when evaluating the union operator <code>|</code>),
an element, text, comment or PI node may be considered identical to an attribute or namespace node
if they happen to be at the same offset in their respective data structures. This problem applies
to the TinyTree only.</p>

<p>The fix for this (tested with 7.6.5) is to add the test:<br />
<code>if (this.getNodeType() != other.getNodeType()) return false;</code><br />
at line 63 of module <code>com.icl.saxon.tinytree.TinyNodeImpl</code></p></li>

<li><p>When the format attribute of <code>xsl:number</code> contains a punctuation token but no formatting tokens
(for example <code>format="*"</code>) Saxon fails with an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. {Test case numb26}</p></li>

<li><p>Saxon reports no error when two named templates in different stylesheet modules have the same name
and the same import precedence. It simply uses the one that comes last.</p></li>

<li><p>If one of the namespace prefixes declared in the <code>exclude-result-prefixes</code> or
<code>extension-element-prefixes</code> attribute of the <code>xsl:stylesheet</code> element of an
included or imported stylesheet module is not the prefix of a declared namespace, then no error is
reported, and all the prefixes in the attribute are ignored.</p></li>

<li><p>Within <code>xsl:for-each</code>, Saxon reports no error if <code>xsl:sort</code> elements
are preceded by other instructions. It behaves as if the <code>xsl:sort</code> elements appeared
first.</p></li>

<li><p>Saxon reports no error if the <code>xsl:with-param</code> element is misspelt, for example as
<code>xsl:width-param</code>. The misspelt element is silently ignored.</p></li>

<li><p>Saxon may report a spurious circularity in attribute-set definitions. The problem occurs if two
attribute-sets in different stylesheet modules happen to share the same node-identifier within their
respective documents, and if one references the other directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>The fix for this (tested but not regression tested) is: in <code>com.icl.saxon.Controller</code>, in 
methods <code>getUserData()</code> and <code>setUserData()</code> (lines 830/843), change the lines 
declaring the variable key to:</p>

<p><code>String key = name + " " + 
                      getDocumentPool().getDocumentNumber(node.getDocumentRoot()) + 
                      node.generateId();</code></p>


<li><p>Saxon returns incorrect results for <code>&lt;xsl:number level="any"&gt;</code> when the
context node is an attribute that does not match the <code>count</code> pattern, and when its parent
is an element that does match the <code>count</code> pattern. The error occurs
only when using the tiny tree model.</p></li> 

<li><p>Saxon treats all non-alphanumeric tokens in the format string of <code>&lt;xsl:number&gt;</code> 
as separator tokens. This means that if multiple numbers are output (using <code>level="multiple"</code>)
with a format such as <code>(1)</code>, the output has the form <code>(3(5(1)</code> whereas the correct
interpretation of the specification produces <code>(3.5.1)</code>.</p><!-- test case: numb35 -->

<p>The fix for this (tested but not regression tested) is: in <code>com.icl.saxon.number.NumberFormatter</code>,
at line 110, replace the line <code>sb.append((String)separators.elementAt(tok));</code> by:</p>

<p><code><pre>
                if (tok==0 && startsWithSeparator) {
                    // The first punctuation token isn't a separator if it appears before the first
                    // formatting token. Such a punctuation token is used only once, at the start.
                    sb.append(".");
                } else {
                    sb.append((String)separators.get(tok));
                }
</pre></code></p></li>

<li><p>When sorting is applied to a the result of an expression that should return a node-set, duplicate nodes
are not always removed from the node-set. For example, this happens if sorting is applied to the result of the
id() function, if the argument to the id() function is such that the same node is selected several times. If the
result is not sorted, duplicates are eliminated correctly.</p>

<p>The fix for this (tested but not regression tested) is in line 136 of SortedSelection.java: change 
<code>selection.enumerate(context, false)</code> to <code>selection.enumerate(context,true)</code>.</p></li>                   

</ol>


<h2>XML 1.0 Conformance</h2>

<p>The default parser is a version of &AElig;lfred. There is one known non-conformance in
the version of the AElfred parser provided with the Saxon product: it does not enforce the
constraint that the contents of a general entity must be well-formed. Note, however, that this
parser does not perform XML validation.</p>

<h2>JAXP Conformance</h2>

<p>When stylesheet output is sent to a user-provided ContentHandler, it's best only to send
a well-formed document. If the result tree is not well-formed, Saxon tries to tell the 
<code>ContentHandler</code> about it by means of a <code>saxon:warning</code> processing instruction. 
However, failures
are likely to follow whether the application responds to this warning or not. It's not clear what
the right thing to do is here; it doesn't seem right to send a ContentHandler an ill-formed
event stream, as it's likely to break. Saxon 7.x adopts the cleaner approach of defining an output
property saxon:require-well-formed="no" to indicate that the ContentHandler is prepared to accept
an ill-formed event stream.</p> 

<p>If the command line (<code>com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet</code>) is invoked with the source document
and/or stylesheet specified as URLs, and a user-written URIResolver is used, and the resolve() method
returns null for the URIs on the command line, then Saxon doesn't try to use the standard URIResolver
instead.</p>

<p>Whitespace stripping does not take place when the transformation is executed using a JAXP
<code>TransformerHandler</code>.</p>
