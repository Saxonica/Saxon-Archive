<H2>Changes in version 7.2 (2002-08-28) </H2>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<div style="border: solid thin; background-color: lime; padding: 1em">
<p>Saxon 7.2 requires Java JDK 1.4</p>
</div>

<p>Saxon 7.2 requires JDK 1.4. This is primarily to support the use of regular expressions: Saxon now uses
the JDK 1.4 regular expression library to support <code>xsl:analyze-string</code> and the functions
<code>matches()</code>, <code>replace()</code>, and <code>tokenize()</code>.</p>

<p>Since JDK 1.4 includes an XML parser, there is no longer any good reason for Saxon to supply its own
XML parser. Therefore AElfred is no longer included in the Saxon package, and the default will be to use
the Crimson parser (or whatever is included in the JDK 1.4 distribution).</p>

<p><i>Note: JDK 1.4 appears to require more [or allocate less] stack space than JDK 1.3, some 
transformations that ran successfully in JDK 1.3 run out of stack space with JDK 1.4. This equally
affects earlier Saxon releases when running with JDK 1.4</i></p>

<h3>Defects Cleared</h3>

<h3>XSLT changes</h3>

<p>Implemented the <code>xsl:analyze-string</code> instruction, which supports regular expression
matching.</p>

<p>Where an embedded expression within an attribute value template yields a sequence of more than one
item, the string values of all the items are now output, separated by spaces. <b>This is incompatible
with XSLT 1.0, which ignored all but the first node in a node-set.</b> If this causes compatibility
problems (a) you can fix it by using the filter <code>[1]</code> after the expression, (b) please
let me know: the XSL WG wants to know whether this incompatible change is likely to cause problems
in practice.</p>

<p>The elements <code>xsl:variable</code>, <code>xsl:param</code>, and <code>xsl:result</code> may
now take a <code>type</code> attribute indicating the required type of the value. The supplied value
will be converted to this type if necessary. The value of the attribute is the same subset of the
XPath SequenceType production as is implemented for "cast as" and "instance of" expressions: basically,
the fixed types such as "item" and "element" and the built-in types such as xs:string and xs:date, followed
by an optional occurrence indicator.

<p>Parameters to <code>xsl:function</code> may no longer specify a default value: all arguments
must be supplied in the function call.</p>
<p>An <code>xsl:message</code> instruction may now appear inside an <code>xsl:function</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>xsl:text</code> instruction may now contain other instructions, such as <code>xsl:value-of</code>.
<i>Pending resolution of issue 132 in the spec, avoid using disable-output-escaping with nested xsl:text
elements. The effect is unlikely to be what you expected.</i>.</p>

<p>It is now an error to specify the <code>mode</code> or <code>priority</code> attributes on an
<code>xsl:template</code> element with no <code>match</code> attribute.</p>

<p>Match patterns using the <code>id()</code> and <code>key()</code> functions can now reference global
variables or parameters for the value of the id or key.</p>

<p>The attributes <code>version</code>, <code>exclude-result-prefixes</code>, and <code>extension-element-prefixes</code>
may now appear on any element in the XSLT namespace. Note that these attributes are prefixed <code>xsl:</code>
when used on a literal result element, but have no prefix when used on an XSLT element.</p>

<p>The attribute <code>[xsl:]default-xpath-namespace</code> is now available on all elements. It defines the defualt
namespace to be used for unprefixed element names in path expressions and patterns.</p>

<p>The <code>xsl:apply-templates</code> element now allows <code>mode="#current"</code> and
<code>mode="#default"</code>. The <code>xsl:template</code> allows the <code>mode</code> attribute
to be a list of mode names, optionally including <code>#default</code> to match the default mode.</p>

<p>The <code>disable-output-escaping</code> attribute of <code>xsl:attribute</code> is implemented, replacing
the <code>saxon:disable-output-escaping</code> extension, which is no longer available.</p>

<p>The <code>xsl:destination</code> element is renamed <code>xsl:principal-result-document</code>. (This was
misdocumented in version 7.1).</p>

<p>Implemented the <code>unparsed-text()</code> function (with the second argument being mandatory).</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>Added a -v option to the command line to request XML validation. This applies to the principal source
document and other files read using the document() function. It requires an XML parser 
that supports validation.</p>

<p>The same feature is available in the API using <code>setFeature(FeatureKeys.VALIDATION, Boolean.TRUE)</code>
on the <code>TransformerFactory</code>.</p>

<p>Added a <code>getTransformer()</code> method to the <code>net.sf.saxon.Filter</code> class that is
created in response to <code>SAXTransformerFactory#newXMLFilter()</code>. This allows setting of stylesheet
parameters, a URIResolver, etc, when using this interface. Not tested.</p>

<p>The standard TraceListener now outputs an abbreviated version of the file name of the stylesheet module
containing an instruction, as well as the line number.</p>

<p>The indentation algorithm for method="xml" has been changed so no extra whitespace is output if there
is already enough whitespace in the result tree: specifically, if a start tag is preceded by a newline and
as many spaces as the indentation would output, then no extra indentation takes place. The effect is to avoid
adding blank lines when copying XML that is already indented. This change does not affect method="html",
because the HTML indentation rules are more complex and can easily affect the appearance of text in the
browser if applied wrongly.</p>


<h3>XPath changes</h3>

<p>Implemented the regular expression functions matches(), replace() and tokenize() as defined
in the <i>Functions and Operators</i> specification;
also the regex-group() function defined in the XSLT 2.0 WD.
</p>

<p>The <code>only</code> option in the construct <code>A instance of [only] B</code> has been
removed, as it is no longer defined in the XPath WD.</p>

<p>Changed the rules for the context document: this is now always the document containing
the context node. If the context item is not a node, there is no context document, and any
absolute path expression (or calls on id(), key(), or unparsed-entity-uri()) will cause a
dynamic error.</p>

<p>Implemented the <code>time</code> data type, the constructor xs:time(),
 and the functions current-date() and current-time(). Time values can be compared for equality or
 ordering, and can be sorted.</p>
 
<p>Implemented the component extraction functions, get-x-from-y, for date, dateTime, and time.</p>

<p>Changed DateTime and time classes so that the timezone is retained as part of the value. Equality
and ordering is done by normalizing the time to UTC, but conversion to a string, and extraction of
components, reflects the timezone as originally specified.<p>

<p>Constructor functions such as dateTime() have been moved to the schema namespace (you can use either
"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" (conventional prefix xs) or "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes"
(conventional prefix xsd). Stylesheets that use these constructor functions must be changed. The 
semantics of these constructor are identical to the cast expression.</p> 

<p>Added the duration data-type, including conversion to and from strings, comparison for equality and
ordering, sorting, and component extraction. (This goes beyond the XPath 2.0 drafts, which do not allow
ordering on durations.) Ordering is based on the average length of a month (one
year = 365.25... days): so <code>P365D &lt; P1Y</code> and <code>P366D &gt; P1Y</code>.
 Component extraction works on any kind of duration, and the functions are currently
named get-X-from-duration(), not get-X-from-yearMonthDuration() or get-X-from-dayTimeDuration().
Arithmetic involving durations or dates is not yet implemented.</p>

<p>Added the two XPath-defined subtypes of duration: xs:dayTimeDuration and xs:yearMonthDuration. 
Implemented the functions to construct these from a number of months or seconds. The "+" and "-" 
operators can be used to add two durations of the same type, and the "*" and "div" operators to
multiply or divide a duration by a number.</p>

<p>Added the subtypes of xs:integer (xs:long, xs:int, xs:short and the rest). The type promotion
rules for comparison and arithmetic on numeric types have been brought into line with the specification,
though there are probably still a few minor discrepancies (especially where fallback conversions
from strings are involved).</p>

<p>Added the <code>idiv</code> operator for integer division. For example, <code>10 idiv 3</code> is 3.
The <code>div</code> operator always returns a double result.</p>

<p>Added the subtypes of xs:string (token, language, Name, NCName, ID, IDREF, ENTITY, NMTOKEN); but not
the list types IDREF, ENTITIES, NMTOKENS. These have no useful functionality beyond the ability to validate
the lexical rules for each type.</p>

<p>Implemented the distinct-nodes() function (at the same time fixing a bug in union, intersect and
except when supplied with arguments that are not in document order).</p>

<p>Implemented the deep-equal() function. 
Because nodes are still untyped, it compares string values of text nodes rather
than typed values. <i>Not yet tested with an explicit collation.</i> </p>

<p>Renamed the sublist() function as subsequence().</p>

<p>Implemented the sequence-node-equal() and sequence-deep-equal() functions. 
<i>Not yet tested with an explicit collation.</i></p>

<p>Implemented the functions node-kind(), root(), context-item().</p>

<p>Added the EXSLT functions in package math: abs, acos, asin, atan, atan2,
constant, cos, exp, log, power, random, sin, sqrt, tan. Thanks to Simon St. Laurent
for these. Only partially tested.</p>

<p>The saxon:intersection and saxon:difference extension functions have been dropped;
instead use either the XPath 2.0 operators (intersect, except) or the EXSLT functions.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>Many internal iterators work with a one-item lookahead. This is wasteful if the iteration is not
continued to completion, which happens for example with a numeric predicate such as expr[1], or
with an existential comparison such as <code>sequenceA = sequenceB</code>, or when converting a
sequence to a string or a boolean. This lookahead has been removed for some commonly used iterations,
notably the FilterIterator, the MappingIterator, and the TinyTree SiblingIterator. 
A consequence is that the hasNext() method of SequenceIterator can now throw an XPathException.</p>

<p>Deferred evaluation of variables happened in the past when the expression was a SequenceExpression.
It now happens only if the compile-time cardinality of the expression allows more than one item. This
means that deferred evaluation will not be used for an expression of the form expr[1]. And when
deferred evaluation is used, the iterator is not primed by calling hasNext(): this means that (for an
iterator that doesn't do lookahead), the search for the first item is now deferred until the variable
is first used, and doesn't have to be repeated unnecessarily. In addition, if the variable is referenced
in a context where only the first item in the sequence is required (e.g. to get the value as a boolean
or as a string), the value is now saved without evaluating the full sequence.</p>

<p>I have added an optimization for constructs of the form <code>&lt;xsl:if test="a | b"&gt;</code>.
Where a union expression is evaluated in a boolean context it is now treated as if the operator were "or".
This potentially avoids the need to sort the two node-sets into document order.</p>

<p>There are some changes in the way global variables are handled. At compile time, a hash table is used
in place of linear searching to search for duplicates: this should improve compilation performance for
stylesheets with many global variables, especially when many of the variables are overridden by an
importing stylesheet. At run-time, evaluation of global variables is now deferred until the first reference
to the variable, which will improve execution performance when there are global variables that are never
referenced. Note that this change will be visible if &lt;xsl:message&gt; is used to trace execution.</p>

<p>A filter expression of the form <code>f[a and b]</code> is now rewritten as <code>f[a][b]</code> when
appropriate, to enable an early exit in the case where <code>a</code> is positional: for example
<code>item[position() = 1 and child::desc]</code>. This is only done if <code>a</code> is positional and
<code>b</code> is not.</p>

<p>A union (or intersection or difference) of two path expressions is now rewritten to do the combination
as late as possible: for example <code> ( /a/b/c | /a/b/d )</code> is rewritten as <code>( /a/b/(c|d) )</code>.
<i>Note, this is a first small step in the identification of common subexpressions. The cases where two
subexpressions are detected as being identical are fairly limited, for example there is no knowledge
of which operators are commutative or associative.</i></p>

<h3>Internal Changes</h3>

<p>The organization of the net.sf.saxon.functions package has changed. Much of the fixed information
associated with individual functions is now contained in a static table in the StandardFunction.java module, rather
than being returned by methods associated with each function. Most of the optimization methods (simplify,
getDependencies, and reduce) now have a generic default implementation in the Function.java class, 
which most of the individual functions now use. This has reduced the overhead associated with implementing
each function, which is important as the number of functions in XPath 2.0 has grown so much. It also creates
further opportunities for combining the implementation of several related functions in one module, with
better ability to share common code.</p>

<p>Unique document numbers are now allocated in the NamePool rather than the DocumentPool. This is
visible in the results of generate-id(), because it means document numbers are not reset at the
beginning of each transformation. This change has been made so that functions that rely on unique
document numbers (for example, comparison of nodes into document order, or the union operation) 
can be done safely in a free-standing XPath environment. Eventually this will also allow
document() to be executed outside an XSLT context - but not yet.</p>

<h3>Integration and Extensions</h3>

<p>I have tested Saxon with the Resin XML parser, but found it very buggy (version 2.1.1)</p>

<p>I have tested Saxon with the Piccolo XML parser (version 1.03), and found it worked very well 
except for a few stress tests, particularly in the area of namespace handling. I have reported four
bugs.</p>

<p>The tables for converting XPath data types to Java types (when calling extension functions) have
been revamped. The design has changed so that where there are two methods that appear to match the
function call, one of them will generally be chosen even if the choice is arbitrary: this is because
in many cases where Java classes define polymorphic methods, the results will be the same whichever
method is chosen.</p>

<H2>Changes in version 7.1 (2002-04-30) </H2>

<h3>Integration</h3>

<p>This version of Saxon has been modified and tested to work with JDOM beta 0.8 and with FOP 0.20.3. 
In both cases, code changes were needed to work with these versions, and I have not tested whether the code
still works with earlier versions; the chances are that it doesn't.</p>

<h3>Error clearance</h3>

<p>In general, bugs that have been cleared in Saxon 6.5.1 or Saxon 6.5.2 have also been cleared in this
release. For details of the clearance of specific bugs, see the bug tracker at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=29872&atid=397617">Sourceforge</a>.
Remember that closed bugs are not listed unless you ask for them.</p>

<h3>Multiple output documents</h3>

<p>The <code>href</code> attribute of <code>xsl:result-document</code> is now interpreted as a relative
URI, relative to the system ID of the principal result document. This works only where the system ID of the
principal output is known, and uses the "file://" protocol. The result document is no longer created
 relative to the current working directory, for security reasons (it causes problems when executing
 an untrusted stylesheet in a servlet environment).</p>
 
<p>Note that when Saxon is invoked from the command line, the -o option should be used to specify the 
principal output destination. This will ensure that a suitable system ID is available. If the result document
is sent to the standard output stream (even if this is redirected to a file), Saxon will not know the
system identifier and will therefore be unable to create a secondary output destination using a relative
URI. It is still possible, of course, to specify an absolute URI as the value of the <code>href</code>
attribute - note that this must be a URL, not a filename, so it will typically start with <code>file://</code>.</p>

<p>It is now possible to specify an OutputURIResolver to be used to resolve the URI specified in the <code>href</code>
attribute of the <code>xsl:result-document</code> element. This will be used in place of the standard output URI
resolver. The OutputURIResolver is called when writing of the output document starts, at which point it must
return a JAXP Result object to act as the output destination. It is called again when writing of an output document
is complete. You can nominate an OutputURIResolver by calling 
<code>((Controller)transformer).setOutputURIResolver(new UserOutputResolver())</code>,
or by calling <code>factory.setAttribute("http://saxon.sf.net/feature/outputURIResolver", 
new UserOutputResolver())</code>.</p>

<p>If the -t option is used, a message is written to the standard error output identifying the 
files written using using <code>xsl:result-document</code>.</p> 

<p>It is now an error to use <code>xsl:result-document</code> when the current output destination
is a temporary tree.</p>



<h3>XSLT changes</h3>

<p>The meaning of the ALLOW_EXTENSION_FUNCTIONS attribute in the TransformerFactory has been
extended so that setting the value to <code>false</code> also disables extension elements and
the creation of multiple output files. This is because all these operations carry similar risks
when a servlet is allowed to execute untrusted stylesheets.</p>

<p>Added support for the <code>separator</code> attribute of <code>&lt;xsl:copy-of&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>current()</code> function may now be used in a pattern (specifically, within a predicate).
 Its value is the node being tested against the pattern. For example, <code>match="*[*[name()=name(current())]"</code> 
 matches any element that contains another element with the same name.</p>
 
<p>A global variable or parameter may now be used in the match pattern of <code>xsl:template</code>, provided that it does
not cause a circularity (that is, it must be possible to evaluate the variable without calling
<code>xsl:apply-templates</code>)</p>

<p>A global variable or parameter may now be used in the match pattern or the use expression 
of <code>xsl:key</code>, provided that it does
not cause a circularity (that is, it must be possible to evaluate the variable without using the <code>key()</code>
function against the key being defined)</p>

<p>The <code>key()</code> function may now be used in the <code>use</code> or <code>match</code> attributes of
<code>xsl:key</code>, provided the key definitions are not circular. (For example, key k1 can be defined
in terms of key k2, provided that k2 is not defined in terms of k1.)</p>

<p>The <code>group-ending-with</code> attribute of <code>xsl:for-each-group</code> is implemented. It is especially
useful where the last node in each group carries some kind of marker, for example <code>continued="no"</code>.</p>

<p>Added attribute <code>default="yes"|"no"</code> to <code>saxon:collation</code>, to specify whether this collation
should be used as the default collation. If more than one collation is specified as the default, the last one wins.
If no default collation is specified, Unicode codepoint collation is used. The default collation is used by
the compare() function if no third argument is supplied, by xsl:sort if no collation is specified (for data type text
or string), and also by the comparison operators =, !=, &lt;, &gt;, etc.</p>

<p>The collation name is now a URI, not a QName.</p>

<p>Sorting and comparison according to Unicode codepoints can be achieved by setting up a collator as 
<code>&lt;saxon:collation name="unicode" class="net.sf.saxon.sort.CodepointCollator"/&gt;</code></p>



<h3>XPath changes</h3>

<p>The implementation of the "and" and "or" operators has reverted to two-valued logic, since
three-valued logic didn't make it into the published XPath 2.0 working draft. (Actually, it
seems 3-valued logic wasn't working in Saxon 7.0 anyway).</p>

<p>Changed the "==" and "!==" operators to "is" and "isnot".</p>

<p>Changed string literals to allow the delimiting quote marks to be doubled. For example,
<code>&lt;xsl:value-of select="'[He isn''t]'"/&gt;</code> displays the string <code>[He isn't]</code></p>

<p>Changed the <code>some</code> and <code>every</code> expressions to allow multiple range variables, 
for example <code>some $i in //I, $j in //J satisfies $i = $j</code></p>

<p>Implemented the singleton value-comparison operators (eq, ne, gt, lt, ge, le). These return an error
if applied to a sequence containing more than one item, and return the empty sequence if either operand
is an empty sequence; when applied to singletons, they return the same result as the XPath 1.0 operators
(=, !=, etc).</p>

<p>Less-than and greater-than comparisons between nodes and/or strings now do a lexicographic comparison
using the default collating sequence; at XPath 1.0 they did a numeric comparison. A warning is output in
this situation (and one or two other situations, but not all) to advise of the backwards incompatibility.</p>


<p>The rules for deciding when path expressions need to be sorted have been revised. As a result
many cases now require no sort where previously a sort was done. Examples of such expressions
include a/b/c, .//a, $x[1]/a, //@a. In addition, most path expressions that return results in
reverse document order are now sorted by a simple reversal, which is much faster than a full sort.</p>

<p><b>There's a temporary bug in that path expressions returning namespace nodes don't always return
them in document order. I'm awaiting resolution of the XPath 2.0 data model rules before fixing this.</b></p>



<p>Suppress lazy evaluation of assignable variables. (This was designed to prevent
a stack overflow, it didn't succeed, but it seems a good idea anyway).</p>

<p>Added the ability for a Source object to be supplied as the value of a stylesheet
parameter or as the value returned by an extension function.</p>

<p>Added dateTime and date data types. Initially the only operations supported are the
currentDateTime function, the dateTime and date constructors, and conversion between
strings, dates, and dateTimes in both directions. Conversion to string uses the timezone
of the current locale.</p>

<p>Implemented comparisons (equals, less-than, etc) between dates and dateTimes.
Also implemented sorting. The data-type of xsl:sort may take the two values "text" or "number" 
(which are treated as synonyms of xs:string and xs:double) or any XML Schema built-in data type
for which sorting is supported. The values in the sequence to be sorted are converted to this
data type (using the same rules as for <code>cast as</code>) and the rules for this data type
determine the sort order.</p>

<p>Note that (as required by the XML Schema specification) dateTime values are normalized to UTC.
The original timezone specified when the dateTime was constructed is not retained. If no timezone
is present, this fact <i>is</i> remembered. Such a dateTime is compared with other dateTimes as if
it were a UTC dateTime.</p>


<p>Implemented the <b>instance of</b> operator (including the <b>instance of only</b> variant):
for example <code>if ($x instance of xs:integer *) then x else y</code>. The types that are currently
supported are the 19 primitive schema types (the namespace may be either of the two namespaces
permitted in XML Schema Part 2), the derived type xs:integer, the node types document, element,
attribute, text, comment, processing-instruction, or namespace, and the abstract types node, and item.
(There is no syntax currently for the general numeric type or for the general atomic type). The
type name may be followed by one of the qualifiers "*", "+", or "?" to indicate the number of 
occurrences; if there is no qualifier, there must be exactly one occurrence. The more sophisticated
forms of type-checking, using schema-defined complex types, are not yet supported.</p>

<p>Implemented the <b>cast as data-type</b> expression, for example <code>cast as xs:boolean($x)</code>.
The conversion rules are the same as those which apply implicitly when a value is supplied
in a context where a different type is expected.</p>

<p>Implemented the <b>treat as data-type</b> expression. This doesn't actually have much use in an
XSLT context, where type conversion is performed implicitly when required, and the semantics of the
expression are probably not correctly implemented at this stage: the specification is still evolving.</p> 



<h3>New XPath API</h3>

<p>A new API has been introduced for executing XPath expressions. This is simpler and safer than the
API provided in previous releases, which was essentially improvised from implementation classes rather
than being designed top-down as an interface suitable for application use. The API is loosely modelled
on the proposed DOM Level 3 API for XPath.</p>

<p>The new API uses the class <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath.XPathEvaluator</code>. This class provides a few
simple configuration interfaces to set the source document, the static context, and the context node,
plus a number of methods for evaluating XPath expressions. The static context can be omitted if the
expression does not use namespaces, external variables, or extension functions. If the expression uses
namespaces, an instance of StandaloneContext can be supplied, allowing the required namespaces to be 
declared either explicitly, or by reference to the in-scope namespaces of some Node.</p>

<p>There are two methods for direct evaluation,
evaluate() which returns a List containing the result of the expression (which in general is a sequence),
and evaluateSingle() which returns the first item in the result (this is appropriate where it is known
that the result will be single-valued). The results are returned as NodeInfo objects in the case of nodes,
or as objects of the most appropriate Java class in the case of atomic values: for example, Boolean, Double,
or String in the case of the traditional XPath 1.0 data types.</p>

<p>It is also possible to prepare an XPath expression for subsequent execution, using the createExpression() method
on the XPathEvaluator class. This is worthwhile where the same expression is to be executed repeatedly.
The compiled expression is represented by an instance of the class net.sf.saxon.xpath.XPathExpression,
and it can be executed repeatedly, with different context nodes. However, the compiled expression is bound
to one particular source document (this is to ensure that the same NamePool is used).</p>

<p>The design principle of this API is to minimize the number of Saxon classes that need to be used.
Apart from the NodeInfo interface, which is needed when manipulating Saxon trees, only the four classes
XPathProcessor, XPathExpression, StandaloneContext, and XPathException are needed. 
For convenience, XPathException and StandaloneContext have been moved to the net.sf.saxon.xpath package.</p>

<p>If you want to use extension functions or variables you will need to create your own implementation
of StaticContext. Although this interface has been greatly simplified, this is still not to be attempted lightly.</p>

<p>The old APIs for executing expressions still exist for the time being, but they are likely to
 be less stable.</p>

<h3>Internal changes</h3>

<p>Changed ContentEmitter to check in startElement() that qname and local-name are both supplied;
this checks against parser configuration errors. This change could (should?) be retrofitted to the 6.5 branch.
The change also uses a stack of namecodes so that endElement() doesn't need to look up the names in 
the name pool. In implementing this change, I discovered that Saxon depends on the XML parser passing
the QName argument to the startElement() call, something which according to the SAX2 specification is
optional. However, all known parsers supply this argument, and the code changes to cope with its absence
would damage performance, so I have simply documented this as a dependency on the parser.</p>

<p>Implemented infrastructure for data type support:</p>

<ul>
<li>A new class net.sf.saxon.value.Type centralizes the definition of node types and atomic types</li>
<li>The tokenizer now does single-token lookahead, needed to support double-keywords such as "cast as"</li>
<li>Added parsing support for "EXPR instance of [only] DATATYPE" and "cast as DATATYPE ( EXPR )"</li>
<li>Added isA method to SimpleValue so each value knows what types (primitive or derived) it belongs to</li>
</ul>

<p>I have changed the implementation of temporary trees (result tree fragments). The FragmentValue class
has disapeared. This delayed the construction of an actual tree until it the tree was actually used as
a node-set: the effect was to optimize simple uses of temporary trees but at considerable cost to the more
general usage which is now permitted in XSLT 2.0. Also, the introduction of tinytrees has reduced the
value of this optimization. Therefore, a temporary tree is now constructed immediately as a real tree.</p>

<p>A side-effect of this change is that when disable-output-escaping is used while writing nodes to a
tree, the instructions to switch escaping on and off are recorded in the tree in the form of the
processing instructions defined by JAXP 1.1. Previously, these instructions were recorded in a form that
kept the information through an xsl:copy-of instruction, but lost the information if the tree was processed
in any other way. Note that the behavior of "sticky d-o-e" (that is, the effect of disabling output
escaping when writing to a temporary tree) is currently an open issue in XSLT 2.0.</p>

<p>The indexes associated with keys are no longer referenced from each document instance, they are
handled externally. This makes it easier to share the same index implementation across all the different
document implementations. The indexes are now held by the KeyManager. It uses a WeakHashMap to ensure
that when a document is removed from memory by the garbage collector, its indexes are removed too.</p>

<p>The mechanism for keeping stylesheet signatures in the namepool has been removed. It caused
a creeping "memory leak" in continuously running services, and is not really needed. It was invented
to allow namepools to be copied, but this facility has never been properly documented or tested.
Instead, there is now a simple check that the source document and stylesheet are using the same
namepool. (This change, or a simplified version of it, has also been made to 6.5.2).</p>

<p>The StaticContext interface has been greatly simplified, reducing duplication and making it easier to
create a new implementation of this interface. This has been achieved partly by doing some work in the 
XPath ExpressionParser that was previously done in the StaticContext, and partly by changing those functions
such as format-number() and sort() that only work in an XSLT context to check that the context is indeed
XSLT before accessing the context information.</p> 

<h3>SQL extension</h3>

<p>At the suggestion of Claudio Thomas [claudio.thomas@web.de], I have extended the <b>sql:query</b> instruction
to allow the attribute <code>disable-output-escaping="yes|no"</code>. This is useful where the database
content being retrieved contains XML or HTML markup that is to be preserved in the output. Use this
with care; it disables escaping for all the rows and columns retrieved, some of which may contain
special characters such as "&lt;" and "&amp;" that do need to be escaped.</p>

<p><i>This change has not been tested.</i></p> 

<h3>Extension functions</h3>

<p>Added extension functions: <a href="extensions.html#parse">saxon:parse()</a> and
<a href="extensions.html#serialize">saxon:serialize()</a>. These allow conversion of a string containing
well-formed XML to a tree structure, and vice-versa.</p>

<p>Added extension functions: <a href="extensions.html#string-to-unicode">saxon:string-to-unicode()</a> and
<a href="extensions.html#unicode-to-string">saxon:unicode-to-string()</a>. These allow conversion between a string and
a sequence of integers representing the Unicode values of the characters in the string.</p>

<p>Added extension functions <a href="extensions.html#pause-tracing">saxon:pause-tracing()</a>
 and <a href="extensions.html#resume-tracing">saxon:resume-tracing()</a>.</p>

<p>The return value from an extension function may now be an implementation of <code>java.util.List</code>,
representing a sequence. The members of the <code>List</code> must all implement <code>net.sf.saxon.om.Item</code></li>

<p>An argument to an extension function may now be the class <code>net.sf.saxon.om.NodeInfo</code>, or
a subclass. If the supplied value is a sequence, the first node in the sequence is passed to the function;
it is an error if there is no node in the supplied sequence, or if the node is of the wrong type.</p>

<p>The rules for calling extension functions with a sequence-valued argument have been clarified, and
some new options are permitted, e.g. declaring the argument as <code>java.util.List</code>. The possibilities
have not been extensively tested.</p>

<p>Implemented memo functions (thanks to Robert Brotherus for the suggestion).
If you specify the attribute <code>saxon:memo-function="yes"</code> on <code>xsl:function</code>,
Saxon will keep a cache that maps the supplied argument values to the result of the
function, and if the function is called twice with the same arguments, the original
result will be returned without re-evaluating the function. Don't use this option on a function
that depends on the context, or on a function that creates a new temporary tree and
is required to create a new instance each time. Also note that there are cases where it
may be faster to re-evaluate the function than to do the lookup; this is especially true
if the argument is a large node-set.</p>

<H2>Changes in version 7.0 (2001-12-20) </H2>

<p>This version introduces initial support of features defined
 in working drafts of XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0.<p>
 
<p><b>Version 7.0 should be regarded as an experimental alpha release. For production
use, please continue to use <a href="http://saxon.sf.net/saxon6.5/">Saxon 6.5</a></b></p>
 
<p>The Saxon package name has changed from <b>com.icl.saxon</b> to <b>net.sf.saxon</b>.
Any applications that use Saxon java classes directly (rather than relying on the JAXP
interface) will need to be modified. Note that this also affects the settings of the system
properties <code>javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory</code> and
 <code>javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory</code>.</p>

<p>The entry point from the command line has changed from <b>com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet</b>
to <b>net.sf.saxon.Transform</b>.

<p>The namespace URI for saxon extensions has changed from <b>http://icl.com/saxon</b>
to <b>http://saxon.sf.net/</b>. Note that many extensions have been withdrawn, as they
are superseded by facilities in XPath 2.0 and/or XSLT 2.0.</p>

<p>To allow coexistence, the name of the JAR file for this release has changed to
<code>saxon7.jar</code>. The SQL extensions are now in a separate JAR file, <code>saxon7-sql.jar</code>.
A transformation can now be executed directly from the JAR file using the command
<code>java -jar saxon7.jar</code> in place of <code>java net.sf.saxon.Transform</code>.</p> 

<p>Saxon now requires JDK 1.2 or later to run. In consequence, Saxon will no longer work
with the Microsoft Java VM, and the Instant Saxon version of the product is therefore
no longer available.</p>

<p>Because Saxon no longer runs with the Java VM, it can now be run as an applet within
Internet Explorer only if the Sun Java plug-in is installed. You can get this from
 <a href="http://java.sun.com/getjava">http://java.sun.com/getjava</a>. This may require
 some configuration changes because of the differences in security policy.</p>
 
<p>The following sections summarize the main new features. These assume familiarity with
the XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 specifications; however, summaries of the new syntax for
 <a href="expressions.html">expressions</a> and <a href="xsl-elements.html">XSLT elements</a>
 are included in this package.</p>

<h3>XPath 2.0 Data Model and Language</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sequences of nodes or simple values are supported, 
including the sequence constructor expression <code>($a, $b, $c)</code>.
Path expressions now return a sequence of nodes containing no duplicates, in document
order.</li>
<li>The new <b>if</b> expressions, <b>for</b> expressions, <b>some</b> and <b>every</b>
expressions are supported.</li>
<li>New operators are implemented: <b>except</b>, <b>intersect</b> and </b>union</b> for
combining sequences (implemented only for sequences of nodes at this release); 
also <b>==</b>, <b>!==</b> for comparing node identity, and <b>&lt;&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;&gt;</b>
for comparing relative position of nodes in document order. These
return () when an operand is (), and fail when an operand contains more than
one node.</li>

<li>Any expression may now appear on the right-hand side of the "/" operator (a run-time error
is reported if it doesn't evaluate to a sequence of nodes). Examples: <code>a/(b|c)/d</code>, 
or <code>document('x')/key('a','b')</code></li>

<li>Added range expressions. For example <code>1 to 10</code> evaluates to the
sequence <code>( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 )</code></li>

<li>The new numeric data types integer, decimal, and float are implemented.
XPath literals, and string-to-number conversion, now allow "e" in a numeric literal. 
A literal containing an "e" is
interpreted as a double, any other literal containing a "." is interpreted as a
decimal, and any other numeric literal as an integer. Integers are limited
to 64-bit quantities, but decimals are of unlimited size. Arithmetic is now done 
using the XPath 2.0 type promotion rules,
except that "div" and "mod" always convert both arguments to double. For the
time being, I have retained the XPath 1.0 rule that the string representation
of a number never ends in ".0"; I found that changing it to use the canonical
representation defined in XML Schema (as required by XPath 2.0) meant rewriting too many
of my tests. However, negative zero now converts to the string "-0" (it was "0" 
at XPath 1.0).</li>


<li>The code for equals, not-equals, etc, has been generalized to work on any sequence
 in the same
way as for a node-set. This retains the "existential" semantics of XPath 1.0. It
still does a comparison of the string-value of each item, not the typed value.</li>

<li>Filter expressions now work on any sequence (including a singleton sequence, so 2[1] is
allowed)</li>

<li>3-valued logic has been implemented for AND and OR. 
(This doesn't reflect the XPath 2.0 working draft as published: a late change was made).</li>

<li>The syntax <code>*:localname</code> (like prefix:*) is allowed in path expressions, and also
in patterns and in <code>xsl:strip-space</code> and </code>xsl:preserve-space</code>. It matches
any node with the given local name, regardless of namespace.</li>

<li>The Context object has been changed so that there is
a context item rather than a context node. The context item is either a simple value or
a node. The expression "." returns the value of the context item. If the context item
is not a node, then relative path expression (including self::node()) return an empty
node-set. Absolute path expressions (starting with "/"), and key() and id(), now apply
to the document containing the <b>current</b> node, as distinct from the context node.
<i>Note: the implementation of context document doesn't accurately reflect the concept
 of the context document in the XPath 2.0 working draft as published.
</i></li>

<li>The rules for string-to-boolean conversion have changed so that "", "0" and "false" 
now return false, all other strings return true.</li>



</ul>

<h3>XSLT 2.0 features</h3>

<ul>
<li>The <code>xsl:value-of</code> element has a new <code>separator</code> attribute, so it can
be used to output a sequence.</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:for-each</code> element supports arbitrary sequences.</li>
<li>The extension elements <code>saxon:group</code> and <code>saxon:item</code> are
withdrawn.</li>
<li>The new <code>xsl:for-each-group</code> instruction, and the associated <code>current-group()</code>
function, are implemented.</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:function</code> and <code>xsl:result</code> elements are implemented;
these replace <code>saxon:function</code> and <code>exslt:function</code>.
Note that the XSLT 2.0 specification is more restrictive as to what can appear in a function
body: it has to be zero or more <code>xsl:param</code> elements, followed by zero or more
<code>xsl:variable</code> elements, followed by an <code>xsl:result</code> element.
However, this is not a serious restriction in practice, because most computations can now
be carried out within a single XPath expression.</li>
<li>The new <code>xsl:namespace</code> instruction is implemented (it writes a 
namespace node to the result tree)</li
<li>The <code>xsl:copy-of</code> can now handle sequences containing simple-values
(the simple value is converted to a string and written to the result tree).
However, the <code>separator</code> attribute is not yet implemented.</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:document</code> element (and its synonym <code>saxon:output</code>)
are replaced by <code>xsl:result-document</code>. This no longer includes the serialization
attributes directly, instead it refers by name to an <code>xsl:output</code> declaration,
or can use the unnamed <code>xsl:output</code> declaration by default.</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:output</code> element now supports <code>method="xhtml"</code>,
replacing <code>method="saxon:xhtml"</code>. The precise details of the output may not be fully
conformant with the specification.</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:destination</code> element is provided, however, since the <code>href</code>
attribute is currently ignored, it is not very useful at this stage.</li>
<li>The <code>saxon:handler</code> element is no longer supported.</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:script</code> element is no longer supported - however,
the synonym <code>saxon:script</code> remains available</li>
<li>A <code>collation</code> attribute has been added to <code>xsl:sort</code>, 
and the implementation of sorting now uses JDK 1.2 collators. The <code>collation</code> 
attribute must match the name attribute of a <code>saxon:collation</code> element.
If none is specified, the <code>lang</code> attribute is now used to select a collator, or if the
<code>lang</code> attribute is omitted, a collator is obtained for the default locale. </li>
<li>Named sort keys are available, via the <code>xsl:sort-key</code> element. A named
sort key may be used to perform a sort from within an XPath expression, using the new
XSLT-defined <code>sort()</code> function.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Function Library</h3>

<p>I have made the following changes to the function library:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>saxon:distinct()</code> extension function now works on any sequence.</li>
<li>The <code>count()</code> and <code>sum()</code> functions now ork on any sequence, 
and new functions <code>avg()</code>, <code>min()</code>, and <code>max()</code> are provided.</li>
<li>Added <code>ends-with()</code></li>
<li>Added <code>upper-case()</code> and <code>lower-case()</code>. 
These use the rules defined by the Java default locale</li>
<li>Added properties "product-name" and "product-version" to <code>system-property()</code></li>
<li>Removed the <code>saxon:range()</code> extension function 
(it can now be done using the syntax "a to b")</li>
<li>Changed <code>saxon:tokenize()</code> to return a sequence of strings instead of a node-set</li>
<li>Changed <code>key()</code> so that the second argument can be any sequence; 
each member of the
sequence is converted to a string and treated as a potential key value</li>
<li>Changed <code>document()</code> so that the first argument can be any sequence; each member of
the sequence can be a URI of a document to be loaded.</li>
<li>Removed the <code>saxon:node-set()</code> extension function, which is now obsolete.</li>
<li>Removed the <code>saxon:if()</code> extension function, which is superseded by XPath 2.0 
conditional expressions.</li>
<li>The <code>saxon:closure()</code> function is temporarily withdrawn, because it relies on non-standard
use of the <code>current()</code> function.</li>
<li>The <code>node-set()</code> function in the EXSLT common module is now a no-op; the object-type()
function returns one of "sequence", "boolean", "number", "string", or "external".</li>
<li>Changed <code>highest()</code> and <code>lowest()</code> in the EXSLT <code>math</code> 
module to work on arbitrary sequences.</li>
<li>Added <code>exists()</code> and <code>empty()</code>, 
<code>insert()</code> and <code>remove()</code>, 
<code>index-of()</code> and <code>sublist()</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code>not3()</code> (three-valued not() function)</li>
<li>Added <code>string-pad()</code> function</li>
<li>Removed <code>saxon:exists()</code> and <code>saxon:for-all()</code>: 
these are superseded by the <code>some</code> and <code>every</code>
constructs in XPath 2.0</li>
<li>Added the <code>compare()</code> function: the third argument (collation) is initially mandatory, and must
be a QName matching a <code>saxon:collation</code> element</li>
<li>Added <code>base-uri()</code> function replacing the undocumented
 <code>saxon:base-uri()</code> extension function</li>
<li>Added constructor functions as described in the XPath Functions and Operators specification: 
some of them don't do much yet, but <code>float()</code> is the only way of creating a single-precision
floating point number.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Significant Omissions</h3>

<p>In general, features of XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0 not listed above have not been implemented.
In particular, these include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Backwards compatibility mode in XSLT</li>

<li>The <code>type</code> attribute of <code>xsl:variable</code>, etc.</li>

<li>Uniform handling of the empty sequence by functions and operators in XPath expressions</li>

<li>XPath constructs related to types, for example <code>instance of</code> and
 <code>cast as</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Internal changes</h3>

<p>As might be expected, the Saxon code has undergone major change internally, which
will affect any application making significant use of internal interfaces. Here are
some of the highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>The NodeEnumeration class is replaced with <b>SequenceIterator</b>. 
This is modelled on the JDK 1.2
Iterator interface, and can return any sequence of Items. An Item is either
a SimpleValue or a NodeInfo.</li>

<li>Added the <b>getAnother()</b> method to the SequenceIterator interface. This means all 
SequenceIterators can clone themselves to produce another SequenceIterator of the same
nodes. (But it's not a pure Java clone, because the new iterator is positioned at the
start of the sequence.) The implementation of <b>last()</b> has changed: 
if the SequenceIterator doesn't know
how many nodes there are in the sequence, the iterator is cloned and the items are counted,
without being saved in memory as previously. This should only happen once for any given
iterator, so in general calling last() causes a node-set to be scanned twice.</li>

<li>The <b>Step</b> class has been removed. A step that is a simple unfiltered
axis expression is now represented by an AxisExpression; a step with filters is 
represented by a FilterExpression, and any other kind of expression may also now be 
used in a PathExpression.</li>

<li>An important new internal class is the <b>MappingIterator</b>. This maps one sequence to
another sequence by invoking a MapppingFunction on each member of the first sequence.
This capability is now used to implement both path expressions and <code>for</code>
expressions. It is also used in various other contexts, e.g. in the implementation of
the document(), key() and id() functions.</li>

<li>The <b>asString</b> method on Value is renamed <code>getStringValue</code>,
this allows both SimpleValues and Nodes to implement the new Item interface, which
represents a member of a sequence.</li>

<li>Internal changes in support of datatypes: I removed evaluateAsDouble(), etc,
 and replaced them with a generic method 
<b>evaluate(context, requiredType)</b>, which always returns a Value. A new
package, <code>net.sf.saxon.value</code>, now contains all the data-type related classes. </li>


<li>The functions key(), id(), and document() are now fully pipelined, that is, they deliver an
iterator over the result nodes.</li>

<li>The classes that handle sorting have been totally rewritten, partly to handle general
sequences, and partly to use collations.</li>

<li>The <b>Context</b> class has changed. There are now two separate classes,
XSLTContext and XPathContext. There is only one XSLTContext object used during a transformation
(the information could have been held in the Controller itself). Stacking of values
in the XSLT context uses the Java program execution stack, in the sense that any routine
that sets a new value has to remember the old value and reset it on completion. The
XPath context, by contrast, still creates a new instance every time a new value is stacked.
This essentially just wraps the SequenceIterator that represents the context node list.
The SequenceIterator itself is responsible for returning current item and current
position.</li>

</ul>

<p>I have removed documentation of the <b>saxon:trace</b> extension attribute; 
it seems this hasn't been working for some time.</p>

<h3>API changes</h3>

<ul>

<li>The <code>Context</code> class no longer implements the XSLT 1.1 WD interface
org.w3c.xsl.XSLTContext.</li> 

<li>Dropped the classes in <code>com.icl.saxon.handlers</code> (ElementHandler etc). It is still
possible for a Java application to register a NodeHandler to receive events; this
must now be written as an implementation of the net.sf.saxon.NodeHandler interface.
See the <b>ShowBooks.java</b> sample application to see how.</li>

<li>It is no longer possible to specify a user-defined collation using the <code>data-type</code>
or <code>lang</code> attribute of xsl:sort; instead, it must be specified using the 
<code>collation</code> attribute,
with a <code>saxon:collation</code> element that maps the named collation to a Java
class that implements the JDK <code>java.util.Comparator</code> interface.</li>

</ul>

<h3>SQL extension elements</h3>

<p>A new <code>sql:query</code> instruction has been added, to accompany the
 existing <code>sql:connect</code>, <code>sql:insert</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Attributes:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top">table</td>
<td>The table to be queried (the contents of the FROM clause of the select statement).
This is mandatory, the value is an attribute value template.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">column</td>
<td>The columns to be retrieved (the contents of the SELECT clause of the select statement).
May be "*" to retrieve all columns. This is mandatory, the value is an attribute value template.</td></tr>  
<tr><td valign="top">where</td>
<td>The conditions to be applied (the contents of the WHERE clause of the select statement).
This is optional, if present the value is an attribute value template.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">row-tag</td>
<td>The element name to be used to contain each row. Must be a simple name (no colon
allowed). Default is "row".</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">column-tag</td>
<td>The element name to be used to contain each column. Must be a simple name (no colon
allowed). Default is "col".</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The <code>xsl:query</code> instruction writes zero or more row elements to the current
result tree, each containing zero or more column elements, which contain the data values.</p>

<p>Thanks to Claudio Thomas [claudio.thomas@web.de] who supplied the original version
of this code.</p>

<p>The SQL extensions are now contained in a separate JAR file, <code>saxon7-sql.jar</code>,
which must be on the class path if these extensions are used.</p>
