<p><b>Release 7.5 updates Saxon to match the specifications published on 2 May 2003</b></p>

<p>Release 7.5 is the latest installment of my experimental implementation of the new
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20">XPath 2.0</a> and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20">XSLT 2.0</a> specifications. This version
introduces a wide range of changes, both internal and external. As always,
these are listed in <a href="changes.html">changes.html</a></p> 

<p>This release is not recommended for production use, since neither the specifications
nor the code are yet stable. The preferred version for production use is
<a href="http://saxon.sf.net/saxon6.5.2/">Saxon 6.5.2</a>.</b></p>

<a NAME="Scope">

<h2>What is Saxon?</h2>
</a>

<p>The Saxon package is a collection of tools for processing XML documents. The main components
are: </p>

<ul>
<li>An XSLT processor, which implements the 
Version 1.0 XSLT and XPath Recommendations from the World Wide Web Consortium, found at
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">
http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt</a> and
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">
http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath</a>
with a number of powerful extensions.</code>.</li>

<li>An XPath processor accessible to Java applications.</li>

</ul>

<p>So you can use Saxon by writing XSLT stylesheets, 
by writing Java applications, or by any combination of the two.</p>

<p>Saxon implements the XSLT 1.0 recommendation, including XPath 1.0, in its entirety.
Saxon 7.5 also implements many features defined in the XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0
working drafts, in particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for multiple output files using <code>xsl:result-document</code></li>

  <li>Full processing capability on temporary trees (previously known as result tree
  fragments)</li>
  
  <li>Support for sequences of nodes and simple values</li>
  
  <li>Grouping facilities</li>
  
  <li>Regular expression processing</li>
  
  <li>Support for the new XPath expressions <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, 
  <code>some</code> and <code>every</code></li>
  
  <li>Support for named collating sequences</li>
  
  <li>Many new functions and operators</li>
  
  <li>Support for new data types, such as dates, times, and durations</li>
  
</ul>

<p>Saxon does not yet implement all of XSLT 2.0 or XPath 2.0. The most notable
omission is support for XML Schema data typing. Most of the important built-in types are supported,
but not user-defined types.</p> 

<p>In addition, Saxon provides an extensive library 
of <a href="extensions.html">extension elements and extension functions</a>,
 all implemented in conformance with the XSLT Recommendation to ensure that 
portable stylesheets can be written. These include the <a href="http://www.exslt.org/">EXSLT</a>
extension libraries <b>common</b>, <b>sets</b>, <b>math</b>, and <b>dates-and-times</b>.
Many of these extensions were pioneered in Saxon and have since become available
in other products.</p>

<p>Saxon also provides an API allowing a Java application to execute XPath expressions and
process the results. This is modelled on the proposed DOM Level 3 API, but adapted to the
requirements of XPath 2.0.</p>

<h2><a NAME="Historical">Historical Note</a></h2>

<p>Saxon is essentially a one-man project: I have done almost all the development myself,
except for a small number of routines which I "borrowed" from other open source products,
and a few add-ons contributed by users.</p>

<p>I originally wrote Saxon to support an internal project in <a HREF="http://www.icl.com">ICL</a>,
and ICL continued to sponsor development of Saxon until my departure from the company 
in January 2001. However, it was never a supported ICL product. My new employers,
<a href="http://www.softwareag.com">Software AG</a>, are continuing
to sponsor the development of Saxon, but again without making it a corporate product.
There is no remaining connection with ICL. 
As always, the software is available entirely without support or warranty, and with
no commitments to any future releases.</p>

<p>The name Saxon was chosen because originally it was a layer on top of SAX. Also, it originally used
the Ælfred parser (among others); Ælfred of course was a Saxon king...</p>

<p><small>I have been asked to point out that the product has no connection with a company
called <strong>Saxon Software</strong>. </small></p>

<hr>
<p>Please read the <a href="conditions.html">Conditions of Use</a>.</p>

<hr>
<a NAME="Support"><h2>Technical Support</h2></a>

<p>Saxon comes with no warranty and no formal technical support service.</p>

<p>If you have questions, however, you can usually get an answer by raising them on the Saxon
discussion list at <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help</a>.</p>

<p>Once registered, you can post messages to <a href="mailto:saxon-help@lists.sourceforge.net">saxon-help@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

<p>If you hit something that looks like a bug, please check the known errors on
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon">the Saxon project pages at SourceForge</a>.
Also check the list archives.</p>

<p>If the query relates to the XSLT/XPath language rather than Saxon itself, it is better to use
 the <a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/xsl/xsl-list/">XSL-list</a>: check first that the query
 isn't already covered in the FAQ. Other useful sites for XSLT information are
 <a href="http://www.xslt.com/">www.xslt.com</a>, 
 <a href="http://www.xmlsoftware.com">www.xmlsoftware.com</a> and
  <a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/">www.jenitennison.com</a>.</p>

<A name="Installation"><h2>Installation</h2></a>

<p><span class="highlight">Existing users please see the file <a href=changes.html>changes.html</a> for
details of incompatible changes in this release.</span></p>

<p>The full Saxon distribution includes source and object code,
 documentation, and <a HREF="samples.html">sample applications</a>.</p>

<p>Saxon can be used either from the command line, or from a Java application, using the
JAXP 1.2 API which is included as a standard feature of JDK 1.4. 
Object code is issued as a JAR file, <b>saxon7.jar</b>, which you must include on your class path.

<p>Saxon no longer includes a built-in XML parser: by default it uses the XML parser supplied with
the Java VM. But you can use it with a different XML
parser if you wish. To do this from the command line, specify the required parser using the
-x or -y options; from the Java API, set the name of the parser class as an attribute of
the TransformerFactory object.</p>

<p>User documentation, covering both the XSLT and Java interfaces, is included in the download in the form
 of extensive <code>javadoc</code> specifications. Be sure to read the package summaries, which give an overview
 in the form of a user guide.
In addition there is an <a href="api-guide.html">introductory overview</a>.</p>


<h3>Prerequisites</b>:</h3>

<p>The following software must be installed separately, it is not included with the Saxon download.</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Java development environment. Saxon 7.5 requires JDK 1.4; this
  means it will no longer work with the Microsoft Java VM.</li>
    
  <li>Saxon has an option to work with a source tree constructed using
   <a href="http://www.jdom.org/">JDOM</a>. Saxon 7.5 is validated with
   both JDOM beta 8 and JDOM beta 9; it may not work with earlier releases.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Saxon has been tested successfully in the past with a wide variety of parsers including
 Xerces, Lark, SUN Project X, Crimson, Piccolo, Oracle XML, xerces, xml4j, and xp. Use of a SAX2-compliant
 parser is now mandatory. All the relevant classes must be installed on your Java CLASSPATH.</p>
 
 <p><i>Saxon doesn't work with the XML parser in Resin, because the Resin parser fails
 (in numerous ways) to conform to the SAX2 specification. The version tested was 2.1.1.</i></p>
 

<p>Because Saxon is run from the command line, you might find it useful (under Microsoft Windows)
 to have a text editor
with better command-line support than the standard DOS window. I use <b>Programmer's File Editor (PFE)</b>,
a free product available from a number of download sites, 
<a href="http://cdnet.softseek.com/Programming/Editors/Review_22841_index.html">listed here</a>,
and also <b>UltraEdit</b>, shareware available from <a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/">www.ultraedit.com</a></p>
