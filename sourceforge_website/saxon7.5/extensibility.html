<a name="Writing-extension-functions"><h2>Writing extension functions</h2></a>

<p>An extension function is invoked using a name such as <code>prefix:localname()</code>.
The prefix must
be the prefix associated with a namespace declaration that is in scope. </p>

<p>Extension functions must be implemented in Java.</p>

<p><b>The command line option -TJ is useful for debugging the loading of Java
extensions. It gives detailed information about the methods that are examined for
a possible match.</b></p>

<p>Saxon supports the <code>&lt;saxon:script&gt;</code>
 element, based on the
<code>&lt;xsl:script&gt;</code> element defined in the (now withdrawn) XSLT 1.1 working draft.
This element defines a mapping between a namespace URI used in calls
of extension functions, and a Java class that contains implementations of these functions.
See <a href="extensions.html#saxon:script">saxon:script</a> for details.</p>

<p>You can also use a short-cut technique of binding external Java classes, by making the
class name part of the namespace URI. In this case, you don't need a <code>&lt;saxon:script&gt;</code>
element.</p>

<p>With the short-cut technique, the URI for the
namespace identifies the class where the external function will be found.
The namespace URI must either be "java:" followed by the fully-qualified class name
 (for example <code>xmlns:date="java:java.util.Date"</code>),
or a string containing a "/", in which the fully-qualified class name appears after the final "/".
(for example <code>xmlns:date="http://www.jclark.com/xt/java/java.util.Date"</code>). The part of
 the URI before the final "/" is immaterial. The class must be on the classpath. For compatibility
 with previous releases, the format <code>xmlns:date="java.util.Date"</code> is also supported.</p>

<p>The Saxon namespace URI "http://saxon.sf.net/" is recognised as a special case, and causes the
function to be loaded from the class <code>net.sf.saxon.functions.Extensions</code>. 
This class name can be specified explicitly if you prefer.</p>

<p>There are three cases to consider: static methods, constructors, and instance-level methods.</p>

<p><b>Static methods</b> can be called directly.
The localname of the function must match the name of a public static method in this class. The names
 match if they contain the same characters, excluding hyphens and forcing any character that follows
 a hyphen to upper-case. For example the XPath function call <code>to-string()</code> matches the Java method
 <code>toString()</code>; but the function call can also be written as <code>toString()</code> if you prefer.</p>
 
 <p>If there are several methods in the class that match the localname, and that have the correct number
 of arguments, then the system attempts
 to find the one that is the best fit to the types of the supplied arguments: for example if the 
 call is <code>f(1,2)</code> then a method with two int arguments will be preferred to one with two String
 arguments. The rules for deciding between methods are quite complex. Essentially, for each candidate method,
 Saxon calculates the "distance" between the types of the supplied arguments and the Java class of the 
 corresponding method in the method's
 signature, using a set of tables given below. For example, the distance between the XPath data type "boolean"
 and the Java class "boolean" is very small, while the distance between an XPath string and a Java boolean
 is much larger. If there is one candidate method where the distances of all arguments are less-than-or-equal-to
 the distances computed for other candidate methods, and the distance of at least one argument is smaller,
 then that method is chosen. 
 If there are several methods with the same name and the correct number of arguments, but none is
 preferable to the others under these rules, an error is reported: the message indicates that there is
 more than one method that matches the function call.</p>
 


<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;xsl:value-of select="math:sqrt($arg)"
   xmlns:math="java:java.lang.Math"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This will invoke the static method java.lang.Math.sqrt(), applying it to the value of the variable
$arg, and copying the value of the square root of $arg to the result tree.</p>

<p><b>Java constructors</b> are called by using the function named <code>new()</code>. 
If there are several constructors, then again
the system tries to find the one that is the best fit, according to the types of the supplied arguments. The result
 of calling <code>new()</code> is an XPath value of type Java Object; the only things that can be done with a Java Object
 are to assign it to a variable, to pass it to an extension function, and to convert it to a string, number,
 or boolean, using the rules given below.</p>

<p><b>Instance-level methods</b> (that is, non-static methods)
 are called by supplying an extra first argument of type Java Object which is the
object on which the method is to be invoked. A Java Object is usually created by calling an extension
 function (e.g. a constructor) that returns an object; it may also be passed to the style sheet as the
 value of a global parameter. Matching of method names is done as for static methods.
 If there are several methods in the class that match the localname, the system again tries to
 find the one that is the best fit, according to the types of the supplied arguments.</p>

 For example, the following stylesheet prints the date and time. This example is copied from the
 documentation of the xt product, and it works unchanged with Saxon, because Saxon
 does not care what the namespace URI for extension functions is, so long as it ends with
  the class name. (Extension functions are likely to be compatible between Saxon and xt
 provided they only use the data types string, number, and boolean).</p>

<code><pre>

&lt;xsl:stylesheet
  version="1.0"
  xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
  xmlns:date="http://www.jclark.com/xt/java/java.util.Date">

&lt;xsl:template match="/">
  &lt;html>
    &lt;xsl:if test="function-available('date:to-string') and function-available('date:new')">
      &lt;p>&lt;xsl:value-of select="date:to-string(date:new())"/>&lt;/p>
    &lt;/xsl:if>
  &lt;/html>
&lt;/xsl:template>

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet>

</pre></code>





<p>A Java method called as an extension function may have an extra first argument of
 class <code>net.sf.saxon.expr.XPathContext</code>.
This argument is not
supplied by the calling XSLT code, but by Saxon itself. The XPathContext object provides methods to access many
internal Saxon resources, the most useful being current() which returns the current Item. 
The XPathContext object is not available with constructors.</p>

<p>If any exceptions are thrown by the method, or if a matching method cannot be found,
processing of the stylesheet will be abandoned. If the tracing option has been set (-T) on the
command line, a full stack trace will be output. The exception will be wrapped in a
TransformerException and passed to any user-specified ErrorListener object, so the ErrorListener
can also produce extra diagnostics.</p>

<h3><a name="function-arguments">Conversion of arguments to the function</a></h3>

 <p>The following conversions are supported between the supplied value of the argument and the declared
 Java class of the argument. The mappings are given in order of preference; a class that appears earlier
 in the list has smaller "conversion distance" than one appearing later. These priorities are used to decide
 which method to call when the class has several methods of the same name. Simple classes (such as boolean)
 are acceptable wherever the corresponding wrapper class (Boolean) is allowed. Class names shown in
 italics are Saxon-specific classes.</p>
 
 <p>If the supplied value is a singleton (a sequence of one item) then the type of that item is decisive. If
 it is a sequence of length zero or more than one, then the general rules for a sequence are applied, and the
 types of the items within the sequence are irrelevant.</p>
 
 <table>
 <tr><td valign="top" width="30%"><b>Supplied value</b></td><td valign="top"><b>Required type</b></td></tr>

 </table>
 
<p>Saxon first tries to select the appropriate method based on the <i>static type</i> of the arguments
to the function call. If there is insufficient information statically, it tries again at run-time, based
on the <i>dynamic type</i> of the arguments once evaluated. This means that the same function call may
invoke different methods on different occasions.</p>

 <p>Note that the XPath value is considered to be one of the singleton classes if it is produced by an
 expression that always produces a singleton. So the expression <code>1+2</code> will be an integer. An
 expression that can potentially produce a sequence of any cardinality is represented in the table above
  by the generic class "sequence". For example, <code>($a to $b)</code> is represented as a sequence, except
  when it can be determined statically that <code>$a</code> and <code>$b</code> are equal, in which case it is represented as an
  integer.</p>
  
  <p><i>These rules will probably be rationalized further in future releases.</i></p>
 
<p>A wrapped Java object may be converted to another data type as follows.

<ul>
<li>It is converted to a string by using its toString() method; if the object is null, the result is
the empty string "".</li>
<li>It is converted to a number by converting it first to a string, and then applying the
XPath number() conversion. If it is null, the result is NaN.</li>
<li>It is converted to a boolean as follows: if it is null, the result is false, otherwise
it is converted to a string and the result is true if and only if the string is non-empty.</li>
</ul> 

<h3><a name="function-result">Result of an extension function</a></h3>

<p>The result type of the method is converted to an XPath value as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the method returns void, the XPath value is an empty sequence.</li>
<li>If the method returns null, the XPath value is a wrapped null Java Object.</li>
<li>If the method is a constructor, the XPath value is of type "wrapped Java object". The only way of
using this is by passing it to another external function, or by converting it to one of the standard
XPath data types as described above.</li>
<li>If the returned value is a Java boolean or Boolean, the XPath result is a boolean.</li>
<li>If the returned value is a Java double or Double, the XPath result is a double.</li>
<li>If the returned value is a Java float or Float, the XPath result is a float.</li>
<li>If the returned value is a Java int, short, long, character, or byte, or one of their object wrapper
equivalents, the XPath result is an integer.</li>
<li>If the returned value is a Java String, the XPath result is a string.</li>

<li>If the returned value is an instance of the Saxon class <code>net.sf.saxon.om.NodeInfo</code>
 (a node in a Saxon tree), the XPath value will be a sequence containing a single node.</li>

<li>If the returned value is an instance of <code>javax.xml.transform.Source</code> 
(other than a <code>NodeInfo</code>), 
a tree is built from the specified <code>Source</code> object, and the root node of this tree is returned as
 the result of the function.</li>

<li>If the returned value is an instance of the Saxon class <code>net.sf.saxon.value.Value</code>,
the returned value is used unchanged.</li>



<li>If the returned value is is an instance of the Saxon class <code>net.sf.saxon.om.SequenceIterator</code>
(an iterator over a sequence), the XPath
value will be the sequence represented by this iterator. It is essential that this iterator
properly implements the method <code>getAnother()</code> which returns a new iterator over the
same sequence of nodes or values, positioned at the start of the sequence.</li>

<li>If the returned value is an instance of the Java class <code>java.util.List</code>, the XPath value will be the
sequence represented by the contents of this <code>List</code>. The members of the list will each be converted
to an XPath value, as if each member was supplied from a separate function call. An error is reported if
the result contains a list nested within another list. The contents of the list are copied immediately on return from the
function, so the <code>List</code> object itself may be safely re-used.</li>

<li>If the returned value is a DOM <code>NodeList</code>, the list of nodes is returned as a Saxon node-set. However,
all the nodes must be instances of class <code>net.sf.saxon.om.NodeInfo</code>, that is, they must use Saxon's tree
implementation, not some third-party DOM. But any implementation of <code>NodeList</code> can be used. The nodes
can come from the original source tree, or from a newly-constructed tree, so long as it is constructed
using Saxon.</li>

<li>If the returned value is a DOM Node that is not an instance of class <code>net.sf.saxon.om.NodeInfo</code>, it is
rejected: the result must use Saxon's DOM implementation, not some third-party DOM.</li>

<li>If the result is any other Java object (including null), it is returned as a "wrapped Java object".</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that Saxon's two principal tree structures both conform to the DOM Core Level 2 interface. However, they are read-only:
any attempt to modify the tree causes an exception. Saxon's trees can only be built using the Saxon
subclasses of the <code>net.sf.saxon.tree.Builder</code> class, and they cannot be modified <i>in situ</i>.
(The simplest way for a Java application to build a Saxon tree is by 
using the <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath.XPathEvaluator</code> class.)</p>

<p>The system function <b>function-available(String name)</b> returns true if there appears
to be a method available with the right name. It does not test whether this method has the appropriate
number of arguments or whether the arguments are of appropriate types. If the function name is "new" it
returns true so long as the class is not an abstract class or interface, and so long as it has at least
one constructor.</p>

<p>There are a number of extension functions supplied with the Saxon product: for details, see
<a href="extensions.html">extensions.html</a>. The source code of these methods, which
in most cases is extremely simple, can be used as an example for writing
other user extension functions. It is found in class <code>net.sf.saxon.functions.Extensions</code>.</p>


<a name="Writing-extension-instructions"><h2>Writing extension instructions</h2></a>

<p>Saxon implements the element extensibility feature defined in the XSLT standard.
 This feature allows you to define your own instruction types for use in the stylesheet. These
 instructions can be used anywhere within a <i>content constructor</i>, for example as a child
 of <code>xsl:template</code>, <code>xsl:if</code>, <code>xsl:variable</code>, or of a literal
 result element.</p>

<p>If a namespace prefix is to be used to denote extension elements, it must be declared in the
<b>extension-element-prefixes</b> attribute on the <code>xsl:stylesheet</code> element, or the
<b>xsl:extension-element-prefixes</b> attribute on any enclosing literal result element or
extension element.

<p>Note that Saxon itself provides a number of stylesheet elements beyond those defined in the
XSLT specification, including <code>saxon:assign</code>, <code>saxon:entity-ref</code>, 
and <code>saxon:while</code>. To enable these, use the standard XSLT extension mechanism: define
<b>extension-element-prefixes="saxon"</b> on the xsl:stylesheet element, or 
<b>xsl:extension-element-prefixes="saxon"</b> on any enclosing literal result element.</p>

<p>To invoke a user-defined set of extension elements, include the prefix in this attribute as
described, and associate it with a namespace URI that ends in "/" followed by the fully qualified
class name of a Java class that implements the <b>net.sf.saxon.style.ExtensionElementFactory</b> interface.
This interface defines a single method, <b>getExtensionClass()</b>, which takes the local name of the element
(i.e., the name without its namespace prefix) as a parameter, and returns the Java class used to
implement this extension element (for example, "return SQLConnect.class"). The class returned must
be a subclass of net.sf.saxon.style.StyleElement.</p>

<p>The best way to see how to implement an extension element is by looking at the example, for SQL
 extension elements, provided in package <b>net.sf.saxon.sql</b>, and at the sample stylesheet <b>books-sql.xsl</b>
 which uses these extension elements. The main methods a <code>StyleElement</code>
 class must provide are:</p>

 <table>
 <tr><td valign=top width="30%">prepareAttributes()</td>
    <td>This is called while the stylesheet tree is still being built, so it should not attempt
    to navigate the tree. Its task is to validate the attributes of the stylesheet element and
    perform any preprocessing necessary. For example, if the attribute is an attribute value template,
    this includes creating an Expression that can subsequently be evaluated to get the AVT's
    value.</td></tr>
 <tr><td valign=top>validate()</td>
    <td>This is called once the tree has been built, and its task is to check that the stylesheet
    element appears in the right context within the tree, e.g. that it is within a template</td></tr>
 <tr><td valign=top>process()</td>
    <td>This is called to process a particular node in the source document, which can be accessed
    by reference to the XSLTContext object supplied as a parameter.</td></tr>
 <tr><td valign=top>isInstruction()</td>
    <td>This should return true, to ensure that the element is allowed to appear
    within a template body.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>mayContainTemplateBody()</td>
    <td>This should return true, to ensure that the element can contain instructions.
    Even if it can't contain anything else, extension elements should allow an xsl:fallback
    instruction to provide portability between processors</td></tr>
 </table>

 <p>The <code>StyleElement</code> class has access to many services supplied either via its superclasses or via
 the XSLTContext object. For details, see the API documentation of the individual classes.</p>

 <p>Any element whose prefix matches a namespace listed in the extension-element-prefixes
 attribute of an enclosing element is treated as an extension element. If no class can be
 instantiated for the element (for example, because no ExtensionElementFactory can be loaded,
 or because the ExtensionElementFactory doesn't recognise the local name), then fallback
 action is taken as follows. If the element has one or more <code>xsl:fallback</code> children, they are
 processed. Otherwise, an error is reported. When <code>xsl:fallback</code> is used in any other context, it
 and its children are ignored.</p>

 <p>It is also possible to test whether an extension element is implemented by using the system
 function <code>element-available()</code>. This returns true if the namespace of the element identifies
 it as an extension element (or indeed as a standard XSLT instruction) and if a class can be instantiated
 to represent it. If the namespace is not that of an extension element, or if no class can be
 instantiated, it returns false.</p>
    

<a name="Writing-input-filters"><h2>Writing input filters</h2></a>

<p>Saxon takes its input from a SAX2 Parser reading from an InputSource. A very useful technique is to
interpose a <i>filter</i> between the parser and Saxon. The filter will typically be an
 instance of the SAX2 <b>XMLFilter</b> class.
</p>

<p>See the TrAX examples for hints on using a Saxon Transformer as part of a chain of
SAX Filters.</p>


<p>Note that Saxon relies on the application to supply a well-balanced sequence
 of SAX events; it doesn't need to be well-formed (the root node can have any number
 of element or text children), but if it isn't well-balanced,
 the consequences are unpredictable.</p>
 
<p>The <code>-x</code> option on the Saxon command line specifies the parser that Saxon will
use to process the source files. This class must implement the SAX2 XMLReader interface, but it
is not required to be a real XML parser; it can take the input from any kind of source file,
so long as it presents it in the form of a stream of SAX events. When using the JAXP API, the
equivalent to the <code>-x</code> option is to call <code>transformerFactory.setAttribute(
net.sf.saxon.FeatureKeys.SOURCE_PARSER_CLASS, 'com.example.package.Parser')</code></p>

<a name="Writing-output-filters"><h2>Writing output filters</h2></a>

<p>The output of a Saxon stylesheet can be directed to a user-defined output filter. This filter can be
defined either as a SAX2 <b>ContentHandler</b>, or
 as a subclass of the Saxon class
<b>net.sf.saxon.event.Emitter</b>. The advantage of using an Emitter is that more information is available
from the stylesheet, for example the attributes of the <code>xsl:output</code> element.</p>

<p>When a ContentHandler is used, Saxon will by default always supply a stream of events corresponding
to a well-formed document. (The XSLT
specification also allows the output to be an external general parsed entity,
 also known as a "well-balanced document".) If the result tree is not
 well-formed, Saxon will raise a dynamic error, unless the ContentHandler indicates that it is prepared
 to accept such a result tree, which it can do by implementing the marker interface
  <code>net.sf.saxon.event.BalancedContentHandler</code>. This interface has no methods.</p>
 
 <p>As specified in the JAXP 1.1 interface, requests to disable or re-enable output escaping
 are also notified to the content handler by means of special processing instructions. The
 names of these processing instructions are defined by the constants PI_DISABLE_OUTPUT_ESCAPING
 and PI_ENABLE_OUTPUT_ESCAPING defined in class <code>javax.xml.transform.Result</code>.</p>
 
 <p>If an Emitter is used, however, it will be informed of all events.</p>

<p>The Emitter or ContentHandler to be used is specified in the <b>method</b> attribute of the
 xsl:output 
element, as a fully-qualified class name; for example
 <code>method="prefix:com.acme.xml.SaxonOutputFilter"</code>. The namespace prefix is ignored, but
 must be present to meet XSLT conformance rules.

<p>See the documentation of class <code>net.sf.saxon.output.Emitter</code> for details of the methods available, or
implementations such as HTMLEmitter and XMLEmitter and TEXTEmitter for the standard output formats
supported by Saxon.</p>

<p>It can sometimes be useful to set up a chain of emitters working as a pipeline. To write a filter
that participates in such a pipeline, the class <b>ProxyEmitter</b> is supplied. Use the class <code>XMLIndenter</code>,
which handles XML indentation, as an example of how to write a ProxyEmitter.</p>

<p>Rather than writing an output filter in Java, Saxon also allows you to process the output through
another XSLT stylesheet. To do this, simply name the next stylesheet in the <code>saxon:next-in-chain</code> attribute
of <code>xsl:output</code>. </p>

<p>Any number of
user-defined attributes may be defined on  <code>xsl:output</code>. These 
attributes must have names in a non-null namespace, which must not be either the XSLT
or the Saxon namespace. These attributes are interpreted as attribute value templates.
The value of the attribute is inserted into the <code>Properties</code> object made available to 
the <code>Emitter</code> handling the output; they will be ignored by the standard output methods,
but can supply arbitrary information to a user-defined output method. The name of the
property will be the expanded name of the attribute in JAXP format, for example
<code>{http://my-namespace/uri}local-name</code>, and the value will be the value as given,
after evaluation as an attribute value template.</p>


<a name="Implementing-a-collating-sequence"><h2>Implementing a collating sequence</h2></a>

<p>It is possible to define a collating sequence for use by xsl:sort. This is controlled through the
<code>class</code> attributes of the <code>saxon:collation</code> element.
See <a href="extensions.html#saxon:collation">saxon:collation</a> for details.</p>


<a name="Implementing-a-numbering-sequence"><h2>Implementing a numbering sequence</h2></a>

<p>It is possible to define a numbering sequence for use by <code>xsl:number</code>. 
This is controlled through the lang
attribute of the <code>xsl:number</code> element. The feature is primarily intended to provide language-dependent numbering,
but in fact it can be used to provide arbitrary numbering sequences: for example if you want to number items
as "*", "†", "‡", "§", "¶" etc, you could implement a numbering class to do this and invoke it say with
lang="x-footnote".</p>

<p>To implement a numberer for language X, you need to define a class <code>net.sf.saxon.number.Numberer_X</code>,
for example <code>net.sf.saxon.sort.Numberer_xfootnote</code>. This must implement the interface <code>Numberer</code>. A (not very
useful) <code>Numberer</code> is supplied for lang="de" as a specimen, and you can use this as a prototype to write your
own. A numbering sequence is also supplied for lang="en", and this is used by default if no other can be loaded.</p>

<p>Note that any hyphens in the language name are ignored in forming the class name, but case is significant.
For example if you specify <code>lang="en-GB"</code>, the Numberer must be named <code>net.sf.saxon.number.Numberer_enGB</code>.</p>

<a name="Adding-an-output-encoding"><h2>Adding an output encoding</h2></a>

<p>If you want to use an output encoding that is not directly supported by Saxon
(for a list of encodings that are supported, see <a href="conformance.html">conformance.html</a>)
you can do this by writing a Java class that implements the interface 
<b>net.sf.saxon.charcode.PluggableCharacterSet</b>.
You need to supply two methods: <code>inCharSet()</code> which tests whether a particular Unicode character
is present in the character set, and <code>getEncodingName()</code> which returns the name given to the
encoding by your Java VM. The encoding must be supported by the Java VM. To use this encoding,
specify the fully-qualified class name as the value of the encoding attribute in xsl:output.</p>

<p>Alternatively, it is possible to specify the CharacterSet class to be used for a named output
encoding by setting the system property, e.g. <code>-D"encoding.EUC-JP"="EUC_JP"</code>; the value
of the property should be the name of a class that implements the
PluggableCharacterSet interface. This indicates the class to be used when the <code>xsl:output</code>
element specifies encoding="EUC-JP".</p>

<a name="Writing-a-uri-resolver"><h2>Writing a URI Resolver for Input Files</h2></a>

<p>Saxon allows you to write your own URIResolver to handle the URIs of input documents, as
defined in the JAXP 1.1 specification. Such a URIResolver is used to process the URIs used
in the <code>xsl:include</code> and <code>xsl:import</code> declarations as well as the
<code>document()</code> function. It is also used to process the URIs supplied for the
source document and the stylesheet on the command line. The URIResolver is called to process
the supplied URI, and it returns a JAXP <code>Source</code> object, which Saxon uses as the source of
the input. Note that the Source must be one of the implementations of Source that Saxon
recognizes, you cannot write your own implementations of the JAXP 1.1 Source class.</p>

<a name="Output-uri-resolver"><h2>Writing a URI Resolver for Output Files</h2></a>

<p>Saxon also allows you to write an OutputURIResolver, which performs an
analogous role for URIs specified in the <code>href</code> attribute of <code>xsl:result-document</code>.
The OutputURIResolver is called when writing of the output document starts, at which point it must
return a JAXP <code>Result</code> object to act as the output destination. It is called again when writing of an output document
is complete.</p>
