<p>This file describes changes for versions 7.0 and later.

see <a href="http://saxon.sf.net/saxon6.5/changes.html"/>http://saxon.sf.net/saxon6.5/changes.html</a>.</p>

<H2>Changes in version 7.0 (2001-12-20) </H2>

<p>This version introduces initial support of features defined
 in working drafts of XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0.<p>
 
<p><b>Version 7.0 should be regarded as an experimental alpha release. For production
use, please continue to use <a href="http://saxon.sf.net/saxon6.5/">Saxon 6.5</a></b></p>
 
<p>The Saxon package name has changed from <b>com.icl.saxon</b> to <b>net.sf.saxon</b>.
Any applications that use Saxon java classes directly (rather than relying on the JAXP
interface) will need to be modified. Note that this also affects the settings of the system
properties <code>javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory</code> and
 <code>javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory</code>.</p>

<p>The entry point from the command line has changed from <b>com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet</b>
to <b>net.sf.saxon.Transform</b>.

<p>The namespace URI for saxon extensions has changed from <b>http://icl.com/saxon</b>
to <b>http://saxon.sf.net/</b>. Note that many extensions have been withdrawn, as they
are superseded by facilities in XPath 2.0 and/or XSLT 2.0.</p>

<p>To allow coexistence, the name of the JAR file for this release has changed to
<code>saxon7.jar</code>. The SQL extensions are now in a separate JAR file, <code>saxon7-sql.jar</code>.
A transformation can now be executed directly from the JAR file using the command
<code>java -jar saxon7.jar</code> in place of <code>java net.sf.saxon.Transform</code>.</p> 

<p>Saxon now requires JDK 1.2 or later to run. In consequence, Saxon will no longer work
with the Microsoft Java VM, and the Instant Saxon version of the product is therefore
no longer available.</p>

<p>Because Saxon no longer runs with the Java VM, it can now be run as an applet within
Internet Explorer only if the Sun Java plug-in is installed. You can get this from
 <a href="http://java.sun.com/getjava">http://java.sun.com/getjava</a>. This may require
 some configuration changes because of the differences in security policy.</p>
 
<p>The following sections summarize the main new features. These assume familiarity with
the XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 specifications; however, summaries of the new syntax for
 <a href="expressions.html">expressions</a> and <a href="xsl-elements.html">XSLT elements</a>
 are included in this package.</p>

<h3>XPath 2.0 Data Model and Language</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sequences of nodes or simple values are supported, 
including the sequence constructor expression <code>($a, $b, $c)</code>.
Path expressions now return a sequence of nodes containing no duplicates, in document
order.</li>
<li>The new <b>if</b> expressions, <b>for</b> expressions, <b>some</b> and <b>every</b>
expressions are supported.</li>
<li>New operators are implemented: <b>except</b>, <b>intersect</b> and </b>union</b> for
combining sequences (implemented only for sequences of nodes at this release); 
also <b>==</b>, <b>!==</b> for comparing node identity, and <b>&lt;&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;&gt;</b>
for comparing relative position of nodes in document order. These
return () when an operand is (), and fail when an operand contains more than
one node.</li>

<li>Any expression may now appear on the right-hand side of the "/" operator (a run-time error
is reported if it doesn't evaluate to a sequence of nodes). Examples: <code>a/(b|c)/d</code>, 
or <code>document('x')/key('a','b')</code></li>

<li>Added range expressions. For example <code>1 to 10</code> evaluates to the
sequence <code>( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 )</code></li>

<li>The new numeric data types integer, decimal, and float are implemented.
XPath literals, and string-to-number conversion, now allow "e" in a numeric literal. 
A literal containing an "e" is
interpreted as a double, any other literal containing a "." is interpreted as a
decimal, and any other numeric literal as an integer. Integers are limited
to 64-bit quantities, but decimals are of unlimited size. Arithmetic is now done 
using the XPath 2.0 type promotion rules,
except that "div" and "mod" always convert both arguments to double. For the
time being, I have retained the XPath 1.0 rule that the string representation
of a number never ends in ".0"; I found that changing it to use the canonical
representation defined in XML Schema (as required by XPath 2.0) meant rewriting too many
of my tests. However, negative zero now converts to the string "-0" (it was "0" 
at XPath 1.0).</li>


<li>The code for equals, not-equals, etc, has been generalized to work on any sequence
 in the same
way as for a node-set. This retains the "existential" semantics of XPath 1.0. It
still does a comparison of the string-value of each item, not the typed value.</li>

<li>Filter expressions now work on any sequence (including a singleton sequence, so 2[1] is
allowed)</li>

<li>3-valued logic has been implemented for AND and OR. 
(This doesn't reflect the XPath 2.0 working draft as published: a late change was made).</li>

<li>The syntax <code>*:localname</code> (like prefix:*) is allowed in path expressions, and also
in patterns and in <code>xsl:strip-space</code> and </code>xsl:preserve-space</code>. It matches
any node with the given local name, regardless of namespace.</li>

<li>The Context object has been changed so that there is
a context item rather than a context node. The context item is either a simple value or
a node. The expression "." returns the value of the context item. If the context item
is not a node, then relative path expression (including self::node()) return an empty
node-set. Absolute path expressions (starting with "/"), and key() and id(), now apply
to the document containing the <b>current</b> node, as distinct from the context node.
<i>Note: the implementation of context document doesn't accurately reflect the concept
 of the context document in the XPath 2.0 working draft as published.
</i></li>

<li>The rules for string-to-boolean conversion have changed so that "", "0" and "false" 
now return false, all other strings return true.</li>



</ul>

<h3>XSLT 2.0 features</h3>

<ul>
<li>The <code>xsl:value-of</code> element has a new <code>separator</code> attribute, so it can
be used to output a sequence.</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:for-each</code> element supports arbitrary sequences.</li>
<li>The extension elements <code>saxon:group</code> and <code>saxon:item</code> are
withdrawn.</li>
<li>The new <code>xsl:for-each-group</code> instruction, and the associated <code>current-group()</code>
function, are implemented.</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:function</code> and <code>xsl:result</code> elements are implemented;
these replace <code>saxon:function</code> and <code>exslt:function</code>.
Note that the XSLT 2.0 specification is more restrictive as to what can appear in a function
body: it has to be zero or more <code>xsl:param</code> elements, followed by zero or more
<code>xsl:variable</code> elements, followed by an <code>xsl:result</code> element.
However, this is not a serious restriction in practice, because most computations can now
be carried out within a single XPath expression.</li>
<li>The new <code>xsl:namespace</code> instruction is implemented (it writes a 
namespace node to the result tree)</li
<li>The <code>xsl:copy-of</code> can now handle sequences containing simple-values
(the simple value is converted to a string and written to the result tree).
However, the <code>separator</code> attribute is not yet implemented.</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:document</code> element (and its synonym <code>saxon:output</code>)
are replaced by <code>xsl:result-document</code>. This no longer includes the serialization
attributes directly, instead it refers by name to an <code>xsl:output</code> declaration,
or can use the unnamed <code>xsl:output</code> declaration by default.</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:output</code> element now supports <code>method="xhtml"</code>,
replacing <code>method="saxon:xhtml"</code>. The precise details of the output may not be fully
conformant with the specification.</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:destination</code> element is provided, however, since the <code>href</code>
attribute is currently ignored, it is not very useful at this stage.</li>
<li>The <code>saxon:handler</code> element is no longer supported.</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:script</code> element is no longer supported - however,
the synonym <code>saxon:script</code> remains available</li>
<li>A <code>collation</code> attribute has been added to <code>xsl:sort</code>, 
and the implementation of sorting now uses JDK 1.2 collators. The <code>collation</code> 
attribute must match the name attribute of a <code>saxon:collation</code> element.
If none is specified, the <code>lang</code> attribute is now used to select a collator, or if the
<code>lang</code> attribute is omitted, a collator is obtained for the default locale. </li>
<li>Named sort keys are available, via the <code>xsl:sort-key</code> element. A named
sort key may be used to perform a sort from within an XPath expression, using the new
XSLT-defined <code>sort()</code> function.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Function Library</h3>

<p>I have made the following changes to the function library:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>saxon:distinct()</code> extension function now works on any sequence.</li>
<li>The <code>count()</code> and <code>sum()</code> functions now ork on any sequence, 
and new functions <code>avg()</code>, <code>min()</code>, and <code>max()</code> are provided.</li>
<li>Added <code>ends-with()</code></li>
<li>Added <code>upper-case()</code> and <code>lower-case()</code>. 
These use the rules defined by the Java default locale</li>
<li>Added properties "product-name" and "product-version" to <code>system-property()</code></li>
<li>Removed the <code>saxon:range()</code> extension function 
(it can now be done using the syntax "a to b")</li>
<li>Changed <code>saxon:tokenize()</code> to return a sequence of strings instead of a node-set</li>
<li>Changed <code>key()</code> so that the second argument can be any sequence; 
each member of the
sequence is converted to a string and treated as a potential key value</li>
<li>Changed <code>document()</code> so that the first argument can be any sequence; each member of
the sequence can be a URI of a document to be loaded.</li>
<li>Removed the <code>saxon:node-set()</code> extension function, which is now obsolete.</li>
<li>Removed the <code>saxon:if()</code> extension function, which is superseded by XPath 2.0 
conditional expressions.</li>
<li>The <code>saxon:closure()</code> function is temporarily withdrawn, because it relies on non-standard
use of the <code>current()</code> function.</li>
<li>The <code>node-set()</code> function in the EXSLT common module is now a no-op; the object-type()
function returns one of "sequence", "boolean", "number", "string", or "external".</li>
<li>Changed <code>highest()</code> and <code>lowest()</code> in the EXSLT <code>math</code> 
module to work on arbitrary sequences.</li>
<li>Added <code>exists()</code> and <code>empty()</code>, 
<code>insert()</code> and <code>remove()</code>, 
<code>index-of()</code> and <code>sublist()</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code>not3()</code> (three-valued not() function)</li>
<li>Added <code>string-pad()</code> function</li>
<li>Removed <code>saxon:exists()</code> and <code>saxon:for-all()</code>: 
these are superseded by the <code>some</code> and <code>every</code>
constructs in XPath 2.0</li>
<li>Added the <code>compare()</code> function: the third argument (collation) is initially mandatory, and must
be a QName matching a <code>saxon:collation</code> element</li>
<li>Added <code>base-uri()</code> function replacing the undocumented
 <code>saxon:base-uri()</code> extension function</li>
<li>Added constructor functions as described in the XPath Functions and Operators specification: 
some of them don't do much yet, but <code>float()</code> is the only way of creating a single-precision
floating point number.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Significant Omissions</h3>

<p>In general, features of XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0 not listed above have not been implemented.
In particular, these include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Backwards compatibility mode in XSLT</li>

<li>The <code>type</code> attribute of <code>xsl:variable</code>, etc.</li>

<li>Uniform handling of the empty sequence by functions and operators in XPath expressions</li>

<li>XPath constructs related to types, for example <code>instance of</code> and
 <code>cast as</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Internal changes</h3>

<p>As might be expected, the Saxon code has undergone major change internally, which
will affect any application making significant use of internal interfaces. Here are
some of the highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>The NodeEnumeration class is replaced with <b>SequenceIterator</b>. 
This is modelled on the JDK 1.2
Iterator interface, and can return any sequence of Items. An Item is either
a SimpleValue or a NodeInfo.</li>

<li>Added the <b>getAnother()</b> method to the SequenceIterator interface. This means all 
SequenceIterators can clone themselves to produce another SequenceIterator of the same
nodes. (But it's not a pure Java clone, because the new iterator is positioned at the
start of the sequence.) The implementation of <b>last()</b> has changed: 
if the SequenceIterator doesn't know
how many nodes there are in the sequence, the iterator is cloned and the items are counted,
without being saved in memory as previously. This should only happen once for any given
iterator, so in general calling last() causes a node-set to be scanned twice.</li>

<li>The <b>Step</b> class has been removed. A step that is a simple unfiltered
axis expression is now represented by an AxisExpression; a step with filters is 
represented by a FilterExpression, and any other kind of expression may also now be 
used in a PathExpression.</li>

<li>An important new internal class is the <b>MappingIterator</b>. This maps one sequence to
another sequence by invoking a MapppingFunction on each member of the first sequence.
This capability is now used to implement both path expressions and <code>for</code>
expressions. It is also used in various other contexts, e.g. in the implementation of
the document(), key() and id() functions.</li>

<li>The <b>asString</b> method on Value is renamed <code>getStringValue</code>,
this allows both SimpleValues and Nodes to implement the new Item interface, which
represents a member of a sequence.</li>

<li>Internal changes in support of datatypes: I removed evaluateAsDouble(), etc,
 and replaced them with a generic method 
<b>evaluate(context, requiredType)</b>, which always returns a Value. A new
package, <code>net.sf.saxon.value</code>, now contains all the data-type related classes. </li>


<li>The functions key(), id(), and document() are now fully pipelined, that is, they deliver an
iterator over the result nodes.</li>

<li>The classes that handle sorting have been totally rewritten, partly to handle general
sequences, and partly to use collations.</li>

<li>The <b>Context</b> class has changed. There are now two separate classes,
XSLTContext and XPathContext. There is only one XSLTContext object used during a transformation
(the information could have been held in the Controller itself). Stacking of values
in the XSLT context uses the Java program execution stack, in the sense that any routine
that sets a new value has to remember the old value and reset it on completion. The
XPath context, by contrast, still creates a new instance every time a new value is stacked.
This essentially just wraps the SequenceIterator that represents the context node list.
The SequenceIterator itself is responsible for returning current item and current
position.</li>

</ul>

<p>I have removed documentation of the <b>saxon:trace</b> extension attribute; 
it seems this hasn't been working for some time.</p>

<h3>API changes</h3>

<ul>

<li>The <code>Context</code> class no longer implements the XSLT 1.1 WD interface
org.w3c.xsl.XSLTContext.</li> 

<li>Dropped the classes in <code>com.icl.saxon.handlers</code> (ElementHandler etc). It is still
possible for a Java application to register a NodeHandler to receive events; this
must now be written as an implementation of the net.sf.saxon.NodeHandler interface.
See the <b>ShowBooks.java</b> sample application to see how.</li>

<li>It is no longer possible to specify a user-defined collation using the <code>data-type</code>
or <code>lang</code> attribute of xsl:sort; instead, it must be specified using the 
<code>collation</code> attribute,
with a <code>saxon:collation</code> element that maps the named collation to a Java
class that implements the JDK <code>java.util.Comparator</code> interface.</li>

</ul>

<h3>SQL extension elements</h3>

<p>A new <code>sql:query</code> instruction has been added, to accompany the
 existing <code>sql:connect</code>, <code>sql:insert</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Attributes:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top">table</td>
<td>The table to be queried (the contents of the FROM clause of the select statement).
This is mandatory, the value is an attribute value template.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">column</td>
<td>The columns to be retrieved (the contents of the SELECT clause of the select statement).
May be "*" to retrieve all columns. This is mandatory, the value is an attribute value template.</td></tr>  
<tr><td valign="top">where</td>
<td>The conditions to be applied (the contents of the WHERE clause of the select statement).
This is optional, if present the value is an attribute value template.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">row-tag</td>
<td>The element name to be used to contain each row. Must be a simple name (no colon
allowed). Default is "row".</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">column-tag</td>
<td>The element name to be used to contain each column. Must be a simple name (no colon
allowed). Default is "col".</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The <code>xsl:query</code> instruction writes zero or more row elements to the current
result tree, each containing zero or more column elements, which contain the data values.</p>

<p>Thanks to Claudio Thomas [claudio.thomas@web.de] who supplied the original version
of this code.</p>

<p>The SQL extensions are now contained in a separate JAR file, <code>saxon7-sql.jar</code>,
which must be on the class path if these extensions are used.</p>
