<p>This page acts as a register of suggestions or ideas for future enhancements
to Saxon, or notes of current restrictions. There is no implication that any of these
will ever be implemented, although any developer who wants to take any of them on is
welcome to contact me.</p>

<p>To add your own suggestions to the list, email
 <a href="mailto:mhkay@iclway.co.uk">Michael Kay</a>. Ideas will
 only be added if I consider the enhancement desirable, and even then
 there is no promise of action.</p>

    <td valign="top">1</td>
    <TD vAlign="top">Norm Walsh suggests that as the Saxon transform operates as a SAX2
    filter, any user-supplied entity resolver ought to be used to resolve the URIs in
    (for example) the document() function, or xsl:include and xsl:import</TD>

  <TR>
    <td valign="top">3</td>
    <TD vAlign="top">An output writer supplied to receive output of the transformation ought

    <TD valign="top">Not urgent.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <td valign="top">8</td>
    <TD vAlign="top">Restriction: if the same document is kept in memory, and several transforms
    are applied using it as input, there may be conflicts if the space-stripping rules in the different stylesheets are incompatible.</TD>
    <TD valign="top">Some improvements in Saxon 6.3.</TD></TR>    
  <TR>
    <td valign="top">9</td>
    <TD vAlign="top">Implement a richer set of international collating and numbering rules</TD>
    <TD valign="top">Not urgent. Some progress made on numbering.</TD></TR>    
  <TR>
    <td valign="top">10</td>
    <TD vAlign="top">Add an extension that allows creation of entity declarations in the internal
    DTD subset of the result document (the specific request was for unparsed entity declarations).</TD>
    <TD valign="top">Done, saxon:doctype.</TD></TR>    
  <TR>
    <td valign="top">11</td>
    <TD vAlign="top">Implement, and invoke, the JAXP javax.xml.parsers interfaces to obtain

  <TR>
    <td valign="top">12</td>

    <TD valign="top">Not urgent.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <td valign="top">13</td>
    <TD vAlign="top">Fit the Java-only Saxon API into the JAXP framework, that is, make

    generated.</TD>
    <TD valign="top">Considering it.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <td valign="top">14</td>
    <TD vAlign="top">Make the PreparedStyleSheet object, and everything it owns,

  <TR>
    <td valign="top">15</td>
    <TD vAlign="top">Provide a SAX filter to do XInclude processing, and allow this
    to be run between the parsing and transformation stages.</TD>
    <TD valign="top">Anyone prepared to do it?</TD></TR></TR>
  <TR>
    <td valign="top">16</td>
    <TD vAlign="top">Replace saxon:preview with a SAX filter that does document splitting,
    applying a transformation to each subtree of the split document, and possibly another
    filter to optionally merge the result trees of these transformations.</TD>
