<a NAME="Scope"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

<p><b>This document describes how to use Saxon as a Java class library, without making any use
of XSLT stylesheets. If you want to know how to control stylesheet processing from a Java
application, see <a href="using-xsl.html">using-xsl.html</a>.</b></p>

<p>The first section below describes Saxon's XPath API. This allows a Java application to execute
XPath expressions against a source document, and manipulate the results. No stylesheet is involved.</p>

<p>Subsequent sections describe more intimate APIs that are available in Saxon.</p>

<p>In addition to the APIs described here, Saxon's JavaDoc documentation describes all the public classes
and methods that are available for advanced users. These are all subject to change from one release to
the next.</p>


<a NAME="Expressions">
<h2>Using XPath Expressions</h2>
</a>

<p>A new API has been introduced for executing XPath expressions. The API is loosely modelled
on the proposed DOM Level 3 API for XPath. For full documentation, see the Javadoc description of package
<code>net.sf.saxon.xpath</code>. A sample application using this API is available: it is called <code>XPathExample.java</code>,
and can be found in the <code>samples/java</code> directory. To run this application, see the instructions
in <a href="samples.html#xpath-example">samples.html</a>.</p>

<p>This API is based on the class <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath.XPathEvaluator</code>. This class provides a few
simple configuration interfaces to set the source document, the static context, and the context node,
plus a number of methods for evaluating XPath expressions.</p>

<p>The <code>XPathEvaluator</code> must be initialized with a source document, which can be supplied
as a JAXP <code>Source</code> object. Any kind of <code>Source</code> object recognized by Saxon is
allowed (including, for example, a JDOM source). This can be supplied either in the constructor for the
<code>XPathEvaluator</code>, or through the <code>setSource</code> method. The <code>setSource</code> 
method returns a <code>net.sf.saxon.om.DocumentInfo</code> object representing the root of the
tree for the document: this is useful if you want to use some of the more advanced features of the 
Saxon API, but you can ignore it if you don't need it.</p>

<p>There are two methods for direct evaluation of XPath expressions,
<code>evaluate()</code> which returns a List containing the result of the expression (which in general is a sequence),
and <code>evaluateSingle()</code> which returns the first item in the result (this is appropriate where it is known
that the result will be single-valued). The results are returned as <code>NodeInfo</code> objects in the case of nodes,
or as objects of the most appropriate Java class in the case of atomic values: for example, Boolean, Double,
or String in the case of the traditional XPath 1.0 data types.</p>

<p>XPath itself provides no sorting capability. You can therefore specify a sort order in which you want
the results of an expression returned. This is done by nominating another expression, via the <code>setSortKey</code>
method: this second expression is applied to each item in the result sequence, and its value determines
the position of that item in the sorted result order.</p>

<p>You can call methods directly on the <code>NodeInfo</code> object to get information about a node: for
example <code>getDisplayName()</code> gets the name of the node in a form suitable for display, and
<code>getStringValue()</code> gets the string value of the node, as defined in the XPath data model. You
can also use the node as the context node for evaluation of subsequent expressions, by calling the
method <code>setContextNode</code> on the <code>XPathEvaluator</code> object.</p>

<p>It is also possible to prepare an XPath expression for subsequent execution, using the 
<code>createExpression()</code> method
on the <code>XPathEvaluator</code> class. This is worthwhile where the same expression is to be executed repeatedly.
The compiled expression is represented by an instance of the class
 <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath.XPathExpression</code>,
and it can be executed repeatedly, with different context nodes. However, the compiled expression is bound
to one particular source document (this is to ensure that the same NamePool is used).</p>

<p>A compiled expression can reference XPath variables; the values of these variables must be supplied
before the expression is evaluated, and can be different each time it is evaluated. To do this you will
need access to the <code>StandaloneContext</code> object used by the <code>XPathEvaluator</code>: you
can get this by calling <code>getStaticContext</code> and casting the result to a <code>StandaloneContext</code>.
 Before compiling
an expression that uses variables, the variables it uses must be declared using the <code>declareVariable()</code> method
on the <code>StandaloneContext</code> class. This method returns a <code>Variable</code> object, whose
<code>setValue()</code> method can be used to set a value for the variable before the expression is
evaluated.</p>

<p>The <code>StandaloneContext</code> object is also needed if the XPath expression uses namespaces (which
it will need to, if the source document itself uses namespaces). Before compiling or evaluating an
XPath expression that uses namespace prefixes, the namespace must be declared. You can do this explicitly
 using the <code>declareNamespace()</code> method on the <code>StandaloneContext</code> object. 
 Alternatively, you can use the <code>setNamespaces()</code> method, which declares all the namespaces
 that are in-scope for a given node in the source document.
 Certain namespaces are predeclared with their conventional prefixes: the XSLT namespace (xsl),
the XML namespace (xml), the XML Schema namespace (xs), and the Saxon namespace (saxon). </p>

<p>All the core XPath functions are available, with the exception of the <code>document</code> function.
The XSLT-specific functions, such as <code>key</code> and <code>generate-id</code>, are not available.
You can call Java extension functions by binding a namespace to the Java class (for example, 
<code>java:java.lang.Double</code>). You can also call Saxon and EXSLT extension functions using their
normal namespace - with the exception of a small number of Saxon extension functions, such as
 <code>saxon:evaluate</code> and <code>saxon:serialize</code>, which work only in an XSLT context.</p>


<p>The design principle of this API is to minimize the number of Saxon classes that need to be used.
Apart from the <code>NodeInfo</code> interface, which is needed when manipulating Saxon trees, only the four classes
XPathProcessor, XPathExpression, StandaloneContext, and XPathException are needed. 
For convenience, these classes are all in the <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath</code> package.</p>



<a NAME="NodeInfo">
<h2>The NodeInfo Object</h2>
</a>

<p>The <b>NodeInfo</b> object represents a node of an XML document. It has a subclass <code>DocumentInfo</code> to
represent the root node, but all other nodes are represented by <code>NodeInfo</code> itself. These follow the
XPath data model closely.</p>

<p><i>In earlier releases, NodeInfo extended the DOM interface <code>Node</code>. This is no longer the case;
it was changed to make it easier to integrate Saxon with other XML tree representations such as JDOM.
However, the main Saxon implementations of the <code>NodeInfo</code> interface continue to also implement the DOM 
<code>Node</code> interface, so you can still use DOM methods by casting the concrete node object to a DOM class.</i></p>

<p>The NodeInfo object provides the application with
information about the node. The most commonly-used methods include:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP">getItemType()</td>
    <td>gets a short identifying the node type (for example, element or attribute). The values are
     consistent with those used in the DOM, and are referenced by constants in the class
     <code>net.sf.saxon.value.Type</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="30%">getDisplayName(), getLocalName(), getPrefix(), getURI()</td>
    <td>These methods get the name of the element, or its various parts. The getDisplayName()
    method returns the QName as used in the original source XML.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP">getAttributeValue()</td>
    <td>get the value of a specified attribute, as a String.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP">getStringValue()</td>
    <td>get the string value of a node, as defined in the XPath data model</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP">getParent()</td>
    <td>get the NodeInfo representing the parent element, (which will be a <code>DocumentInfo</code> object
     if this is the outermost element).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP">getEnumeration()</td>
    <td>returns an SequenceIterator object that can be used to iterate over the nodes on any of the
    XPath axes. The first argument is an integer identifying the axis; the second is a <code>NodeTest</code> (a
    simple form of pattern) which can be used to filter the nodes on the axis. Supply <code>AnyNodeTest.getInstance()</code>
    if you want all the nodes on the axis. (For most applications, it is probably simpler to navigate
    from a node by compiling an XPath expression, and executing it with the correct starting node as
    the context node).</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<a NAME="Parser">
<h2>Building the Source Document</h2>
</a>

<p>The first thing the application must do is to build the source document, in the form of a tree.
The simplest approach is to use the sequence:</p> 

<p>
<table border="1" width="100%" class="code">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#00FFFF"><pre><code>
        String systemId = new File(sourceFile).toURL().toString();
        DocumentInfo doc = new XPathEvaluator().setSource(
                             new SAXSource(new InputSource(systemId)));
    <code></pre></td>
  </tr></table></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the JAXP 1.1 interface. For example:</p>

<p>
<table border="1" width="100%" class="code">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#00FFFF"><pre><code>
        System.setProperty("javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory",
             "net.sf.saxon.om.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl");
        DocumentBuilderFactory dfactory =
            DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();

        dfactory.setNamespaceAware(true);

        DocumentBuilder docBuilder = dfactory.newDocumentBuilder();
        
        String systemId = new File(sourceFile).toURL().toString();
        Node doc = docBuilder.parse(new InputSource(systemId));
    <code></pre></td>
  </tr></table></p>
  

<p>You can define the parser to be used by supplying a parser within the <code>SAXSource</code> object
supplied to the <code>Builder.build()</code> method. If you don't supply a parser, Saxon will select one
using the JAXP mechanisms, specifically, the system property <code>javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory</code>.
</p>

<p>If you want to use different parsers depending on the URI of the document being read,
you can achieve this by writing a <code>URIResolver</code> that nominates the parser to be used for each
input file.</p>

<a NAME="Controller">
<h2>Event-based Processing: the Controller</h2>
</a>

<p><i>The ability to register node handlers with the Controller is withdrawn at this release.</i></p>
