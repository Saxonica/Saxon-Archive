<h3>Schema Processing</h3>

<p>In XSLT, the <code>xsl:import-schema</code> declaration is now implemented. The referenced schema is read, parsed,
and validated. (This is implemented using a forked copy of the relevant parts of the Castor product:
for implementation detail see below.)</p>

<p>In XQuery, the <code>import schema</code> declaration in the prolog is implemented. The validation
declaration in the prolog is implemented. Element validation is implemented; validation is suppressed
for element constructors that are content-defining children of another element constructor, 
as it would be redundant. The validate expression is implemented. Validation mode is inherited,
but non-global validation context is not yet implemented.</p>

<p>A schema loaded using an <code>xsl:import-schema</code> statement is cached in the Configuration object,
making it available to all other stylesheets compiled using the same <code>TransformerFactory</code>
instance.</p>

*** cache not currently used at schema module level. ***

<p>Constructor functions for user-defined atomic types in the schema are implemented in both XSLT
and XQuery. The supplied value
is checked against the schema-defined facets for the target type.</p>

<p>The <code>cast as</code>, <code>castable as</code>, and <code>instance of</code> operators are also
 implemented for user-defined atomic types.</p>
 
<p>The validation for user-defined atomic types uses the facets: pattern, length, minLength, maxLength,
enumeration, minInclusive, maxInclusive, minExclusive, maxExclusive.</p>

*** totalDigits and fractionDigits not yet tested.

*** inherited facets not yet tested.
  
 
<p>The <code>type</code> attribute can be used on <code>xsl:element</code>, <code>xsl:attribute</code>,
and <code>xsl:copy</code>,
and the <code>xsl:type</code> attribute on literal result elements, to annotate an attribute or element
node with a user-defined simple type (which can be an atomic type, a list type, or a union type).</p>

<p>The option <code>xsl:validation="strict"</code> is working on literal result elements. {schema061}</p>

<p>The <code>default-validation</code> attribute on <code>xsl:stylesheet</code> is implemented. {schema001}</p>

<p>The <code>validation</code> attribute on <code>xsl:result-document</code> is implemented. 
This checks document-level constraints in the schema (for example <code>xs:unique</code>) as well
as doing local element and attribute validation. {schema069}</p>

<p>The <code>validation</code> attribute on <code>xsl:attribute</code> is implemented (all
four options). {schema070}</p>

<p>A new <code>TransformerReceiver</code> class has been implemented, similar to JAXP's TransformerHandler,
but using the Saxon native Receiver interface rather than SAX2. This allows elements and attributes passed
down the pipeline to have a type annotation, and it avoids converting from name codes to strings and back again.
This mechanism is now used by saxon:next-in-chain.</p>

<p>The schema-aware functionality is now separated into the <code>com.saxonica</code> package hierarchy.</p>

<p>The use of <code>type</code> and <code>validation</code> attributes is now not allowed except when using
the schema-aware configuration.</p>

<p>A variant of <code>net.sf.saxon.Transform</code> is now available called <code>com.saxonica.Transform</code>;
this invokes the schema-aware processor.</p>

** type on result-document not implemented
** validation=lax not implemented
** Syntax implemented but has no effect on xsl:copy-of


<p>The KindTests <code>element(*, T)</code> and <code>attribute(*, T)</code> can be used to test whether
an element or attribute has a particular type annotation, where T is any atomic type (built-in or
user-defined).</p>

<p>The KindTests <code>element(N)</code>, <code>element(N, *)</code>, and <code>element(N, T)</code> (and
the corresponding forms for attributes) are implemented. However, at this stage substitution groups are
not handled, <code>nillable</code> is not implemented, and schema context paths are not implemented.</p> 

<p>The KindTest <code>document-node(element(~,~))</code> is implemented, but is currently available for
use only within a SequenceType or within an XSLT pattern. It is not yet supported for use in a path
expression. {schema065}</p>
 
<p>The alternative namespace <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes</code> is no longer supported.</p>

<p>The built-in list types <code>NMTOKENS</code>, <code>IDREFS</code>, and <code>ENTITIES</code> are working
(only the first one tested). {schema020}</p>

*** check the minLength of each of these: zero or one? ***

<p>User-defined list types are also working {schema039}. The length, minLength, and maxLength facets
are implemented for list types {schema041, 042, 043}.</p>

<p>User-defined union types, including lists of unions, are working {schema044-046}.</p>

<p>Local validation of element content against named complex types is working. Tested using sequence,
choice, groups, wildcards, derivation by extension. {schema050-057, plus associated error cases}</p>

<p>Validation of attributes is working, including checking for required attributes, checking fixed
values, and expanding default values. {schema058-059}</p>

<p>Validation of complex types with simple content is working, including validation of attributes.
{schema060}</p>

<p>Validation of <code>xs:all</code> is working. {schema068, together with associated error cases}</p>

<p>Validation is taking substitution groups into account. {schema061, schema068}</p>

*** subst groups not implemented yet for element(X,Y) node tests ***

<p>Within a schema, the <code>xs:import</code> and <code>xs:include</code> declarations are working.
{schema066, schema067}.</p>

<p>***** The castor data model imposes a restriction that the default values on the <code>schema</code>
element (for example <code>elementFormDefault</code>) in an included schema cannot differ from the
corresponding attributes in the including schema. This constraint is now checked.</p>




<p>An option has been added to the Configuration class and to the TransformerFactory to allow
schema validation of source documents to be requested. This applies to any input document supplied
in the form of a SAXSource or StreamSource (but not a DOMSource, or a pre-built Saxon document) either
as an initial input document, or returned from the doc() or document() functions. It does not apply
to documents returned as the result of an extension function, or documents supplied as stylesheet or query
parameters.</p>

<p>This option can be switched on using the <code>-val</code> option on the command line for 
<code>net.sf.saxon.Transform</code></p>




<h4>Changes made to Castor code</h4>

<p>Many classes and methods that are not needed by Saxon have been removed (Castor is over 70K lines
of code but fewer than 9K have been taken into Saxon).</p>

<p>The package and class names have been changed.</p>

<p>Annotations in the schema are no longer retained in the object model; this has enabled the removal
of classes such as AnyNode, SAX2ANY, etc which maintained part of the schema using a general-purpose
tree.</p>

<p>Replaced Castor's <code>Configuration</code> object (and properties file) with a reference to Saxon's
<code>Configuration</code> object.</p>

<p>Replaced Castor's <code>URIResolver</code> with the JAXP-conformant URIResolver mechanisms already
existing in Saxon. A Schema module can now be loaded from any kind of Source object (including, for
example, a JDOM source).</p>

<p>Replaced <code>FacetList</code> with a standard <code>ArrayList</code>.</p>

<p>Generally corrected javadoc comments, and removed redundant code as identified by IntelliJ IDEA.</p>

<p>Castor's <code>SimpleTypeFactory</code> loaded the definitions of XML Schema built-in types from an
XML file, using Castor's marshalling/unmarshalling framework to do so. In order to avoid including this
whole framework in Saxon, this has been rewritten to use direct in-line definitions of the built-in types
(which already existed in Saxon anyway, to a large extent). The remaining methods in <code>SimpleTypeFactory</code>
have been absorbed into the <code>Schema</code> class.</p>

<p>Extensive improvements have been made to Castor's error handling. Errors were being reported via a wide
range of different mechanisms, and this has been consilidated. Errors detected during the schema building
process are now reported to the ErrorListener as they are encountered, with source file location information,
and processing continues despite the error. Currently only one error may be detected during the subsequent 
validation phase, and it is reported without any location information. The class <code>SchemaException</code>
is used consistently for errors in the schema. Some cross-validation was not being done,
and some user errors were being reported through low-level Java exceptions, causing a stack trace and a
lack of useful error information. The class <code>ValidationException</code> is now used exclusively for
reporting validation errors when source data does not match schema-defined types.</p>

<p>The way that forwards references are handled has generally been simplified. The general model is to
save the NamePool fingerprint of the referenced object within the referring object, and resolve the
reference during the validate() phase when the whole schema model is checked for consistency.</p>
