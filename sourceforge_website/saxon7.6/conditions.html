<p>The Original Code of Saxon comprises all those components which are not explicitly attributed
 to other parties.</p> 

<p>The Initial Developer of the Original Code was Michael Kay of International Computers Limited.
Individual modules identified as being created by other individuals include
 separate IPR notices. Other contributors are acknowledged individually in comments attached to the relevant code
modules.  All Rights Reserved.</p> 

<p><small><i>Since February 2001 I (Michael Kay) have been an employee of Software AG, and
I continue to develop Saxon with the support and sponsorship of that company. Technically,
therefore, the "Initial Developer" no longer exists (the form of words was deliberately chosen
to reflect the joint involvement of myself and ICL), so I now work as a "Contributor".
International Computers Limited has since been absorbed into Fujitsu Limited, and trades as 
<a href="http://services.fujitsu.com/">Fujitsu Services</a>.</i></small> </p>

<p>If you produce a product that includes or requires Saxon, please refer to it as
&quot;The Saxon XSLT Processor from Michael Kay&quot;, and include the URL of the
home page, which is at
<a HREF="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">http://saxon.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee of technical support, though I am usually able to answer enquiries
within a few days. Please subscribe to the mailing list available at
 <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help"/>
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help</a> and raise any enquiries there. 
Also check the Saxon project pages on sourceforge for details of known errors; all bugs are
listed there as soon as I have sufficient evidence to describe the nature of the problem.</p>

<h2>&AElig;lfred</h2>

<p>Earlier versions of the Saxon distribution included a modified version of the &AElig;lfred XML parser from
<a href="http://www.microstar.com">Microstar</a>. Since Saxon now uses JDK 1.4, which includes an XML parser,
there is no longer any need to supply an XML parser with Saxon.</p>

<hr>

<h2>JAXP</h2>

<p>Earlier versions of the Saxon distribution included a copy of the JAXP 1.1 library (Java API for XML). 
Since this is now supplied as part of JDK 1.4, it is no longer distributed with Saxon.</p>
