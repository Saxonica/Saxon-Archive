<h1>Standards Conformance</h1>

<h2>XSLT 1.0 and XPath 1.0 conformance</h2>

<p><i>Saxon XSLT implements the
XSLT 1.0 and XPath 1.0 Recommendations from the World Wide Web Consortium, found at
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">
http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt</a> and
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">
http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath</a>, which are 
referred to here collectively as "XSLT"</i></p>

<p>Saxon is 100% conformant to the mandatory requirements of these recommendations,
except in some cases where incompatibilities have been introduced in the
XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0 working drafts.</p>

<h2>XSLT 2.0 conformance</h2>

<p>This release of Saxon
implements many facilities defined in the draft XSLT 2.0 specification. This specification
is not yet complete, though most features defined in the working drafts of 2 May 2003 are available. </p>

<p>Known restrictions include the following:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The <code>xsl:schema-import</code> declaration is not implemented; and therefore, 
it is not possible to refer to user-defined types.</p></li>

<li><p>There is no support for source documents, result documents, or temporary trees to be
validated and annotated using a schema processor. (But elements and attributes that have a simple
built-in type, for example xs:date, can be annotated as such).</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>as</code> attribute on <code>xsl:template</code> is not implemented</p></li>

<li><p>In <code>xsl:for-each-group</code>, each item in the population is allocated to exactly
one group. Sequence-valued grouping keys are not supported, and the function <code>current-grouping-key</code>
is not implemented.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>xsl:value-of</code> instruction outputs only the first item of a sequence if the
<code>separator</code> attribute is omitted. When <code>version="2.0"</code> is specified, it should output
all items, space-separated.</p></li>

<li><p>It is not possible to for a local variable to shadow another local variable with the
same name.</p></li>

<li><p>The new XSLT 2.0 facilities for initiating a transformation are not provided (specifying a named
template as the entry point, supplying an input collection, etc.)</p></li>

<li><p>The new <code>xsl:output</code> option  <code>normalize-unicode</code>
is not implemented.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>xsl:character-map</code> facility is not yet implemented.</p></li>

<li><p>exclude-result-prefixes="#all" is not yet implemented.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>as</code> attribute is not implemented on elements <code>xsl:key</code>
or <code>xsl:for-each-group</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>xhtml</code> output method does not follow all the rules for XHTML formatting in
the draft XSLT 2.0 specification.</p></li>

<li><p>If <code>key()</code> is called in a match pattern, the argument must be a string literal.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>XPath 2.0 conformance</h2>

<p>Saxon 7.4 implements
the full XPath 2.0 grammar with the exception of schema-related
aspects of the <code>SequenceType</code> production. The SequenceType production currently allows either
a node-kind (e.g. element, attribute, document-node), a built-in simple schema type (e.g. xs:integer, xs:ID), or the
constructs "element(*,T)" and "attribute(*,T)" where T is a built-in simple schema type. Note
that the latter require the type annotation of the node to be T, this can be set using the type-annotation
attribute of xsl:element and xsl:attribute.</p>

<p>The restrictions in XPath 2.0 support include the following:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Saxon supports the following data types: string, boolean, decimal, duration, integer, float,
double, date, dateTime, time, anyURI, QName, with their literal forms and constructors. All built-in subtypes of
integer are implemented (but note, unsignedLong does not support values greater than the maximum
value of a Long). All built-in types derived by restriction from xs:string are implemented (but not
the list types IDREFS, NMTOKENS, and ENTITIES). The data types yearMonthDuration, dayTimeDuration, 
untypedAtomic, and anyAtomicType are available in the namespace <code>http://www.w3.org/2003/05/xpath-datatypes</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Subtraction of two dates to yield a duration,
and addition of a date to a duration, are not yet implemented.</p></li>

<li><p>Casting of a QName to a string, and vice versa, are not supported.</p></li>

<li><p>The type tests element(XX) and attribute(XX) are supported as part of the SequenceType
production, but not in steps of a path expression or match pattern.</p></li>

<li><p>The state of implementation of all the standard functions is described in
<a href="functions.html">functions.html</a></p></li> 

<li><p>Standard functions are implemented in the null namespace; it is not possible to use the namespace
URI defined in the <i>Functions and Operators</i> specification.</i></p></li>

<li><p>Note that in the dateTime and time data types, the timezone is retained as part of the value. Equality
and ordering is done by normalizing the time to UTC, but conversion to a string, and extraction of
components, reflects the timezone as originally specified.<p></li>

<li><p>Constructor functions for schema-defined types are available in both the schema-defined namespaces 
"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" (conventional prefix xs) and "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes"
(conventional prefix xsd). They are available for all the built-in data types that have been implemented.
The semantics are the same as a cast, that is, <code>xs:dateTime($x)</code> means exactly the same as
 <code>cast as xs:dateTime($x)</code>.</p></li>
 
<li><p>Ordering is implemented as a total order over all durations, based on the average length of a month
(one year = 365.242199 days).</p> </li>
 
<li><p>In replace(), if the pattern matches a zero-length string, each character in the source text
is replaced by two instances of the replacement text. This is the Java behavior.</p></li>

<li><p>There are many areas where the semantics implemented by Saxon still reflect the XPath 1.0 rules,
for example the rules for conversion of numbers to strings. In some cases the XPath 2.0 rules in
these areas are not yet stable (that is, there are open issues documented in the current working
draft).</p></li>

</ul>

<a name="xquery"><h2>XQuery 1.0 Conformance</h2></a>

<p>The restrictions noted above with respect to XPath 2.0 apply equally to Saxon's support for
XQuery 1.0.</p>

<p>Additional restrictions in Saxon compared with the May 2003 draft of XQuery 1.0 include the
following:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The <code>typeswitch</code> expression is not implemented.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>validate</code> expression is not implemented.</p></li>

<li><p>Multiple modules are not implemented.</p></li>

<li><p>The processor is not schema-aware, and therefore does not support the
<code>import schema</code> declaration in the prolog.</p></li>

<li><p>Not all options of <code>order by</code> are implemented, for example empty
sort key values are always collated first.</p></li>

<li><p>Constructors for document nodes are not implemented, and constructors for text
nodes have not been tested.</p></li>

<li><p>In computed element and attribute constructors, the computed name must be a string
in the form of a lexical QName, not a value of type xs:QName.</p></li>

<li><p>User-defined functions must have namespace-prefixed names.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>as</code> clause in variable declarations (both global variables, and <code>for</code>
and <code>let</code> variables) follow the XSLT rules, which are based on the XPath function calling
rules, rather than the stricter XQuery rules. That is, the supplied value is converted to the declared
type in three circumstances: atomization of nodes, casting of untyped atomic, and numeric promotion.</p></li> 

<li><p>The <code>as</code> clause in <code>some</code> and <code>every</code> expressions is not
implemented.</p></li>
</ul>



<h2>Conformance with other specifications</h2>

<p>Saxon is dependant on the user-selected XML parser to ensure conformance with the XML 1.0
Recommendation and the XML Namespaces Recommendation.</p>

<p>Saxon implements the <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt;</code> processing instruction as described in the 
W3C Recommendation <i>Associating StyleSheets with XML Documents</i>.
The <b>href</b> pseudo-attribute must be a URI identifying an XML document containing a stylesheet,
or a URI with a fragment identifier identifying an embedded stylesheet. The fragment must be the value
of an ID attribute declared as such in the DTD.</p>

<p>Saxon works with any SAX2-conformant XML parser that is configured to enable namespace 
processing. There is one limitation: on the startElement() call from the XMLReader to the
ContentHandler, the QName (that is, the third argument) must be present. According to the SAX2
specification, namespace-aware parsers are not obliged to supply this argument. However, all
commonly-used parsers appear to do so.</p>


<hr>


<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>The XSLT specification says that the documentation for an implementation should specify
which URI schemes
are supported. Saxon supports the URI scheme implemented by the Java java.net.URL class, with
the optional addition of a fragment identifier, as described below. 
Additionally,
Saxon allows the user to nominate a URIResolver class which can be used to implement any URI scheme
the user wants.</p>

<p>The XSLT specification says that the documentation for an implementation should specify for which
media types fragment identifiers are supported. The standard URI resolver supports access to 
XML documents 
only. A simple fragment identifier is allowed, consisting of the value of an ID attribute in the
document. The effect is to return the subdocument rooted at the element with this identifier if there
is one, or an empty document otherwise. For example, the URI mydoc.xml#aaa locates the XML document
mydoc.xml, and if it contains an element &lt;eeee id="aaa"&gt;, where id is an attribute of type ID, then
the document retrieved is an XML document with this &lt;eeee&gt; element as its outermost (document) 
element.</p>

<p>The values of the vendor-specific system properties are:</p>

<table>
<tr><td width="120">xsl:version</td><td>1.8</td></tr>
<tr><td>xsl:vendor</td><td>SAXON n.n.n from Michael Kay</td></tr>
<tr><td>xsl:vendor-url</td><td>http://saxon.sf.net/</td></tr>
<tr><td>xsl:product-name</td><td>SAXON</td></tr>
<tr><td>xsl:product-version</td><td>n.n.n</td></tr>
</table>

<p>All these values are subject to change in future releases. Users wishing to test whether the
processor is Saxon are advised to test whether the xsl:product system property has the value
"SAXON".</p>

<p><i>The reason for returning 1.8 from <code>xsl:version</code> is that the product
is not yet fully conformant with XSLT 2.0</i></p>

<h3>Extensions</h3>

<p>Saxon implements a number of extensions to standard XSLT, following the rules for extension
functions and extension elements where appropriate. The extensions are documented in
<a href="extensions.html">extensions.html</a>. They are all implemented in accordance with
the provisions in the standard for extensibility.</p>

<h2>Character encodings supported</h2>

<p>The encodings supported on input depend entirely on your choice of XML parser.</p>

<p>The encodings available on output are the intersection of:</p>

<pre>
ascii, us-ascii, utf-8, utf8, utf-16, utf16, iso-8859-1, iso-8859-2
koi8-r, cp852, cp1250, windows-1250, cp1251, windows-1251
(again case-insensitive)
</pre>

<p>with whatever your Java VM supports.</p>

<p>If you select an encoding that the Java VM recognizes, but which is not in the 
above list, then the output will be written in the requested encoding, but all non-ASCII
characters will be written as character references.</p>

<h2>XML 1.0 Conformance</h2>

<p>Saxon can be used with any SAX-conformant XML parser. The extent of XML conformance
depends entirely on the chosen parser.</p>

<p>The default parser is the one supplied with JDK 1.4, which is a version of Apache Crimson.</p>

<h2>DOM Conformance</h2>

<p>Saxon accepts input (both source document and stylesheet) from any standards-compliant DOM
implementation.</p>

<p>Saxon allows the result tree to be attached to any Document or Element node of an existing
DOM. Any DOM implementation can be used, provided it is mutable.</p>

<p>Saxon's internal tree structure (which is visible through the Java API, including the case
where Java extensions functions are called from XPath expressions) conforms with the minimal
requirements of the DOM level 2 core Java language binding. This DOM interface is read-only,
so all attempts to call updating methods throw an appropriate DOM exception. No optional
features are implemented. The DOM interfaces to Saxon's tree structure do not reveal namespace
nodes as attributes. This means it is not possible to get information about namespace
declarations except by calls such as getPrefix() and getNamespaceURI() on Element and Attr nodes).</p>

<p>If an extension function returns a DOM Node or NodeList, this must consist only of Nodes
in a tree constructed using Saxon. Since Saxon's trees cannot be updated using DOM methods, this
means that the nodes returned must either be nodes from the original source tree, or nodes from
a tree constructed using Saxon's proprietary API. It is <b>not</b> possible to construct
the tree using DOM methods such as createElement() and createAttribute().</p>

<h2>JAXP 1.2 Conformance</h2>

<p>Saxon implements the JAXP 1.2 API (including TrAX), as defined in
<a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr063/index2.html">JSR-63</a>.
Saxon implements the interfaces in the javax.xml.transform package in full, including support for
SAX, DOM, and Stream input, and SAX, DOM, and Stream output.</p>

<p><i>Note: The transformation interfaces in JAXP 1.2 are identical to JAXP 1.1: the new version
only affects the XML parser interface, adding options to control schema validation.</i></p> 

<p>There are restrictions in using transform() on a DOMSource when the node to be transformed
is a node other than the root (i.e. the DOM Document node). These apply only if the
supplied DOM is a third-party DOM, not if it is a Saxon-constructed tree.
Specifically, if the start node
is not the root then it must be an element; and it must not have an ancestor or preceding-sibling
node, or an ancestor with a preceding-sibling node, that is an entity reference node or CDATA
section node. In addition, the element must be part of a tree that is rooted at a Document node.</p>

<p>Saxon also implements part of the javax.xml.parsers API. Saxon no longer provides its own SAX parser, 
however it does provide a DocumentBuilder.
The DOM interfaces are limited by the capabilities of the Saxon DOM, specifically the fact that
it is read-only. Nevertheless, the DocumentBuilder may be used to construct a Saxon tree, or to
obtain an empty Document node which can be supplied in a DOMResult to hold the result of a
transformation.</p>

<a name="errorrecovery"><h2>Error recovery policy</h2></a>

<p>Where the XSLT specification requires that an error be signaled, Saxon produces an error
message and terminates stylesheet execution. In the case of errors detected at compile
time, it attempts to report as many errors as possible before terminating; in the case
of run-time errors, it terminates after the first error.</p>

<p>Where the XSLT specification states that the processor may recover from an error, Saxon takes
one of three actions as described in the table below. Either it signals the error and terminates
execution, or it recovers silently from the error in the manner permitted by the specification,
or it places the action under user control. In the latter case there are three options: report the
error and terminate, recover silently, or (the default) recover after writing a warning
 to the system error output stream. These actions can be modified by supplying a user-defined
 ErrorListener.</p>

<p>Handling of individual recoverable errors is described in the table below.</p>

<p><i>This list is incomplete and needs to be reviewed.</i></p>

<table>
<tr><td><b>Error</b></td><td><b>Action</b></td></tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">There is more than one template rule that matches a node, with the
same import precedence and priority</td>
