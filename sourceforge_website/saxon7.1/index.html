<a NAME="Scope">

<h2>What is Saxon?</h2>
</a>

<p>The Saxon package is a collection of tools for processing XML documents. The main components
are: </p>

<ul>
<li>An XSLT processor, which implements the 
Version 1.0 XSLT and XPath Recommendations from the World Wide Web Consortium, found at
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">
http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt</a> and
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/xpath</a>
with a number of powerful extensions.</code>.</li>

<li>A Java library, which supports a similar processing model to XSL, but allows full programming
 capability, which you need if you want to perform complex processing of the data or to access
 external services such as a relational database</li>

<li>A slightly improved version of the &AElig;lfred parser from
<a href="http://www.microstar.com">Microstar</a>. (But you can use Saxon with any
 SAX-compliant XML parser if you prefer).</li>
</ul>

<p>So you can use Saxon by writing XSLT stylesheets, 
by writing Java applications, or by any combination of the two.</p>

<p>Saxon implements the XSLT 1.0 recommendation, including XPath 1.0, in its entirety.
Saxon 7.1 also implements many features defined in the XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0
working drafts, in particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for multiple output files using <code>xsl:result-document</code></li>

  <li>Full processing capability on temporary trees (previously known as result tree
  fragments)</li>
  
  <li>Support for sequences of nodes and simple values</li>
  
  <li>Support for the new XPath expressions <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, 
  <code>some</code> and <code>every</code></li>
  
  <li>Support for named collating sequences</li>
  
  <li>Many new functions and operators</li>
  
  <li>Support for <code>dateTime</code> and <code>date</code> types</li>
  
</ul>

<p>Saxon does not yet implement all of XSLT 2.0 or XPath 2.0. The most notable
omission is support for XML Schema data typing. The data types currently supported
are boolean, string, decimal, integer, float, double, date, and dateTime.</p> 

<p>In addition, Saxon provides an extensive library 
of <a href="extensions.html">extension elements and extension functions</a>,
 all implemented in conformance with the XSLT 1.0 standard to ensure that 
portable stylesheets can be written. These include the <a href="http://www.exslt.org/">EXSLT</a>
extension libraries <b>common</b>, <b>sets</b>, <b>math</b>, and <b>dates-and-times</b>.
Many of these extensions were pioneered in Saxon and have since become available
in other products.</p>

<p>Saxon also includes a number of powerful extension functions that
go beyond EXSLT. Most of these rely on the concept of "stored expressions"
as an additional data-type: this allows an XPath expression to be constructed
at run-time from a string, and allows an expression to be passed as an argument
to a function (which in effect provides higher-order functions). This allows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>distinct() to provide grouping capability on any calculated value</li>  
  <li>sum(), min() and max(), of any calculated value (although this can now be
  done with a <code>for</code> expression in XPath 2.0)</li> 
  <li>expression() and evaluate() to allow an XPath expression to be constructed dynamically, passed
  to the stylesheet as a parameter, or read from the source document.</li>

</ul>

<p>As a Java class library, Saxon gives you the ability to use the XSLT rule-based approach to
document processing, but with the flexibility of the full Java language. You can declare
handler classes to match particular patterns in the document, and can process arbitrary
sets of nodes selected using XPath expressions. This provides a high-level query capability which
you can mix with purely navigational access.</p>

<p>Saxon also provides an API allowing a Java application to execute XPath expressions and
process the results. This is modelled on the proposed DOM Level 3 API, but adapted to the
requirements of XPath 2.0.</p>

<h2><a NAME="Historical">Historical Note</a></h2>

<p>Saxon is essentially a one-man project: I have done almost all the development myself,
except for a small number of routines which I "borrowed" from other open source products,
and a few add-ons contributed by users.</p>

<p>I originally wrote Saxon to support an internal project in <a HREF="http://www.icl.com">ICL</a>,
and ICL continued to sponsor development of Saxon until my departure from the company 
in January 2001. However, it was never a supported ICL product. My new employers,
<a href="http://www.softwareag.com">Software AG</a>, are continuing
to sponsor the development of Saxon, but again without making it a corporate product.
There is no remaining connection with ICL. 
As always, the software is available entirely without support or warranty, and with
no commitments to any future releases.</p>

<p>The name Saxon was chosen because originally it was a layer on top of SAX. Also, it uses
the Ælfred parser (among others); Ælfred of course was a Saxon king...</p>

<p><small>I have been asked to point out that the product has no connection with a company
called <strong>Saxon Software</strong>. </small></p>

<hr>
<p>Please read the <a href="conditions.html">Conditions of Use</a>.</p>

<hr>
<a NAME="Support"><h2>Technical Support</h2></a>

<p>Saxon comes with no warranty and no formal technical support service.</p>

<p>If you have questions, however, you can usually get an answer by raising them on the Saxon
discussion list at <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help</a>.</p>

<p>Once registered, you can post messages to <a href="mailto:saxon-help@lists.sourceforge.net">saxon-help@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

<p>If you hit something that looks like a bug, please check the known errors on
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon">the Saxon project pages at SourceForge</a>.
Also check the list archives.</p>

<p>If the query relates to the XSLT/XPath language rather than Saxon itself, it is better to use
 the <a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/xsl/xsl-list/">XSL-list</a>: check first that the query
 isn't already covered in the FAQ. Another useful site for XSLT information is
 <a href="http://www.xslinfo.com">www.xslinfo.com</a></p>

<hr>

<A name="Installation"><h2>Installation</h2></a>

<p><font color="#FF0080">Existing users please see the file <a href=changes.html>changes.html</a> for
details of incompatible changes in this release.</font></p>

<p>The full Saxon distribution includes source and object code,
 documentation, and <a HREF="samples.html">sample applications</a>.</p>

<p>Saxon can be used either from the command line, or from a Java application, using the
JAXP 1.1 API defined by the Java Community Process. Object code is issued as a JAR file, <b>saxon7.jar</b>, which you must include on your class path.

<p>Saxon includes a built-in XML parser, but you can use it with a different XML
parser if you wish. To do this from the command line, specify the required parser using the
-x or -y options; from the Java API, set the name of the parser class as an attribute of
the TransformerFactory object.</p>

<p>User documentation, covering both the XSLT and Java interfaces, is included in the download in the form
 of extensive javadoc specifications. Be sure to read the package summaries, which give an overview
 in the form of a user guide.
In addition there is an <a href="api-guide.html">introductory overview</a>.</p>


<h3>Prerequisites</b>:</h3>

<p>The following software must be installed separately, it is not included with the Saxon download.</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Java development environment. Saxon 7.1 requires JDK 1.2 or later; this
  means it will no longer work with the Microsoft Java VM.</li>
    
  <li>Saxon has an option to pass the result tree to Apache's <a href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/">FOP
   processor</a>, which is capable of generating output in PDF. Saxon 7.1 is validated with
   FOP version 0_20_3; it probably will not work with earlier releases.</li> 

  <li>Saxon has an option to work with a source tree constructed using
   <a href="http://www.jdom.org/">JDOM</a>. Saxon 7.1 is validated with
   JDOM version 0.8; it may not work with earlier releases.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Saxon comes with a bundled XML parser, a modified copy of the
 <a href="http://www.microstar.com">&AElig;lfred</a> parser, adapted to
notify comments to the application. Saxon has been tested successfully in the past with 
 Xerces, Lark, SUN Project X, Crimson, Oracle XML, xerces, xml4j, and xp. Use of a SAX2-compliant
 parser is preferred, as SAX1 does not allow XML comments to be passed to the application.
 However, Saxon works with either.
 All the relevant classes must be installed on your Java CLASSPATH.</p>

<p>An interactive debugger for Saxon has been written by
 <a href="mailto:edwin@pannenleiter.de">Edwin Glaser</a>. It is still at an
 early stage of development. The software can be downloaded from
  <a href="http://tbug.sourceforge.net"/>http://tbug.sourceforge.net</a>. It is
  issued in tar/gzip format, but it can be unpacked on a Windows machine using WinZIP.</p>

<p>Because Saxon is run from the command line, you might find it useful (under Microsoft Windows)
 to have a text editor
with better command-line support than the standard DOS window. I use <b>Programmer's File Editor (PFE)</b>,
a free product available from a number of download sites, 
<a href="http://cdnet.softseek.com/Programming/Editors/Review_22841_index.html">listed here</a>,
and also <b>UltraEdit</b>, shareware available from <a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/">www.ultraedit.com</a></p>
