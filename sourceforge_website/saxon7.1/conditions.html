<h2>Saxon</h2>

<p>The contents of the downloaded file (saxon.zip), with the exception of the
 &AElig;lfred parser (see below),
 are subject to the Mozilla Public License Version 1.0
(the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

<p>Software distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" basis,
 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
  See the License for the specific language governing rights and limitations under the License.<p> 

<p>The Original Code of Saxon comprises all those components which are not explicitly attributed
 to other parties. It does not include the &AElig;lfred parser, which is redistributed under
 the licence described below.</p> 

<p>The Initial Developer of the Original Code was Michael Kay of International Computers Limited.
Individual modules identified as being created by James Clark, David Megginson, or John Cowan include
 separate IPR notices. All Rights Reserved.</p> 

<p><small><i>Since February 2001 I (Michael Kay) have been an employee of Software AG, and
I continue to develop Saxon with the support and sponsorship of that company. Technically,
therefore, the "Initial Developer" no longer exists (the form of words was deliberately chosen
to reflect the joint involvement of myself and ICL), so I now work as a "Contributor".
Other contributors are acknowledged individually in comments attached to the relevant code
modules.</i></small> </p>

<p><small><i>iclway is an Internet Service Provider operated by ICL; however,
the fact that I continue to use this ISP for hosting Saxon does not imply that 
ICL have any interest in the content of the site. Equally, for reasons of continuity,
I have kept the icl.com domain name in package names and namespace URIs with the tacit
consent of ICL, but this should not be taken to imply any ongoing ICL involvement.</small></i></p>

<p>If you produce a product that includes or requires Saxon, please refer to it as
&quot;The Saxon XSLT Processor from Michael Kay&quot;, and include the URL of the
home page, which is at
<a HREF="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">http://saxon.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee of technical support, though I am usually able to answer enquiries
within a few days. Please subscribe to the mailing list available at
 <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help"/>
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help</a> and raise any enquiries there. 
Also check the Saxon project pages on sourceforge for details of known errors; all bugs are
listed there as soon as I have sufficient evidence to describe the nature of the problem.</p>

<h2>&AElig;lfred</h2>

<p>Included in the Saxon distribution is a modified version of the &AElig;lfred XML parser from
<a href="http://www.microstar.com">Microstar</a>. I have taken the relevant part of
 <A href="mailto:david-b@pacbell.net">David Brownell</a>'s
 <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/david-b/xml/">&AElig;lfred2</a> distribution, repackaged it,
  and fixed a few bugs. All cahnges are clearly documented in the source code.</p>

<p>This is distributed under the terms of Microstar's terms and conditions, which are as follows:</p>

<table><tr><td width=100></td><td>

<p>The version included with Saxon is David Brownell's code of 26 Feb 2000,
modified as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Changed the package name to com.icl.saxon.aelfred to prevent any accidental confusion with the
 original Microstar code or with David Brownell's version.</li>
<li>Fixed several bugs: (1) a bug in namespace handling (where an attribute xxx:name precedes the xmlns:xxx
 declaration) (2) poor diagnostics when end of file occurs prematurely </li>
<li>Subsetting the code to include only the XML non-validating parser and SAX driver, with appropriate
changes to the setFeature() and getFeature() methods.</li>
<li>Some further changes made by David Brownell up to June 2001 have been incorporated.</li>
</ul>

<h2>JAXP</h2>

<p>Included with the Saxon distribution is a copy of the JAXP 1.1 library (Java API for XML). The version
is not the reference version distributed by Sun, but a more recent bug-cleared version distributed as
part of the Apache Xalan product. For information about different JAXP versions, see the JAXP FAQ at
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/~edwingo/jaxp-faq.html">http://xml.apache.org/~edwingo/jaxp-faq.html</a>.
