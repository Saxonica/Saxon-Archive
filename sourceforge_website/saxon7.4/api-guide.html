<a NAME="Scope"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

<p><b>This document describes how to use Saxon as a Java class library, without making any use
of XSLT stylesheets. If you want to know how to control stylesheet processing from a Java
application, see <a href="using-xsl.html">using-xsl.html</a>.</b></p>

<p>The first section below describes Saxon's XPath API. This allows a Java application to execute
XPath expressions against a source document, and manipulate the results. No stylesheet is involved.</p>

<p>Subsequent sections describe more intimate APIs that are available in Saxon. Some of these are historic,
and are not necessarily stable. Saxon offers an event-based API that allows a source document to be
processed using the same processing model as XSLT (that is, particular <i>node handlers</i> are fired
to process individual nodes, selected according to the patterns that match each node).</p>

<p>In addition to the APIs described here, Saxon's JavaDoc documentation describes all the public classes
and methods that are available for advanced users. These are all subject to change from one release to
the next.</p>


<a NAME="Expressions">
<h2>Using XPath Expressions</h2>
</a>

<p>A new API has been introduced for executing XPath expressions. The API is loosely modelled
on the proposed DOM Level 3 API for XPath. For full documentation, see the Javadoc description of package
<code>net.sf.saxon.xpath</code>. A sample application using this API is available: it is called <code>XPathExample.java</code>,
and can be found in the <code>samples/java</code> directory. To run this application, see the instructions
in <a href="samples.html#xpath-example">samples.html</a>.</p>

<p>This API is based on the class <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath.XPathEvaluator</code>. This class provides a few
simple configuration interfaces to set the source document, the static context, and the context node,
plus a number of methods for evaluating XPath expressions.</p>

<p>The <code>XPathEvaluator</code> must be initialized with a source document, which can be supplied
as a JAXP <code>Source</code> object. Any kind of <code>Source</code> object recognized by Saxon is
allowed (including, for example, a JDOM source). This can be supplied either in the constructor for the
<code>XPathEvaluator</code>, or through the <code>setSource</code> method. The <code>setSource</code> 
method returns a <code>net.sf.saxon.om.DocumentInfo</code> object representing the root of the
tree for the document: this is useful if you want to use some of the more advanced features of the 
Saxon API, but you can ignore it if you don't need it.</p>

<p>There are two methods for direct evaluation of XPath expressions,
<code>evaluate()</code> which returns a List containing the result of the expression (which in general is a sequence),
and <code>evaluateSingle()</code> which returns the first item in the result (this is appropriate where it is known
that the result will be single-valued). The results are returned as <code>NodeInfo</code> objects in the case of nodes,
or as objects of the most appropriate Java class in the case of atomic values: for example, Boolean, Double,
or String in the case of the traditional XPath 1.0 data types.</p>

<p>XPath itself provides no sorting capability. You can therefore specify a sort order in which you want
the results of an expression returned. This is done by nominating another expression, via the <code>setSortKey</code>
method: this second expression is applied to each item in the result sequence, and its value determines
the position of that item in the sorted result order.</p>

<p>You can call methods directly on the <code>NodeInfo</code> object to get information about a node: for
example <code>getDisplayName()</code> gets the name of the node in a form suitable for display, and
<code>getStringValue()</code> gets the string value of the node, as defined in the XPath data model. You
can also use the node as the context node for evaluation of subsequent expressions, by calling the
method <code>setContextNode</code> on the <code>XPathEvaluator</code> object.</p>

<p>It is also possible to prepare an XPath expression for subsequent execution, using the 
<code>createExpression()</code> method
on the <code>XPathEvaluator</code> class. This is worthwhile where the same expression is to be executed repeatedly.
The compiled expression is represented by an instance of the class
 <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath.XPathExpression</code>,
and it can be executed repeatedly, with different context nodes. However, the compiled expression is bound
to one particular source document (this is to ensure that the same NamePool is used).</p>

<p>A compiled expression can reference XPath variables; the values of these variables must be supplied
before the expression is evaluated, and can be different each time it is evaluated. To do this you will
need access to the <code>StandaloneContext</code> object used by the <code>XPathEvaluator</code>: you
can get this by calling <code>getStaticContext</code> and casting the result to a <code>StandaloneContext</code>.
 Before compiling
an expression that uses variables, the variables it uses must be declared using the <code>declareVariable()</code> method
on the <code>StandaloneContext</code> class. This method returns a <code>Variable</code> object, whose
<code>setValue()</code> method can be used to set a value for the variable before the expression is
evaluated.</p>

<p>The <code>StandaloneContext</code> object is also needed if the XPath expression uses namespaces (which
it will need to, if the source document itself uses namespaces). Before compiling or evaluating an
XPath expression that uses namespace prefixes, the namespace must be declared. You can do this explicitly
 using the <code>declareNamespace()</code> method on the <code>StandaloneContext</code> object. 
 Alternatively, you can use the <code>setNamespaces()</code> method, which declares all the namespaces
 that are in-scope for a given node in the source document.
 Certain namespaces are predeclared with their conventional prefixes: the XSLT namespace (xsl),
the XML namespace (xml), the XML Schema namespace (xs), and the Saxon namespace (saxon). </p>

<p>All the core XPath functions are available, with the exception of the <code>document</code> function.
The XSLT-specific functions, such as <code>key</code> and <code>generate-id</code>, are not available.
You can call Java extension functions by binding a namespace to the Java class (for example, 
<code>java:java.lang.Double</code>). You can also call Saxon and EXSLT extension functions using their
normal namespace - with the exception of a small number of Saxon extension functions, such as
 <code>saxon:evaluate</code> and <code>saxon:serialize</code>, which work only in an XSLT context.</p>


<p>The design principle of this API is to minimize the number of Saxon classes that need to be used.
Apart from the <code>NodeInfo</code> interface, which is needed when manipulating Saxon trees, only the four classes
XPathProcessor, XPathExpression, StandaloneContext, and XPathException are needed. 
For convenience, these classes are all in the <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath</code> package.</p>



<a NAME="NodeInfo">
<h2>The NodeInfo Object</h2>
</a>

<p>The <b>NodeInfo</b> object represents a node of an XML document. It has a subclass <code>DocumentInfo</code> to
represent the root node, but all other nodes are represented by <code>NodeInfo</code> itself. These follow the
XPath data model closely.</p>

<p><i>In earlier releases, NodeInfo extended the DOM interface <code>Node</code>. This is no longer the case;
it was changed to make it easier to integrate Saxon with other XML tree representations such as JDOM.
However, the main Saxon implementations of the <code>NodeInfo</code> interface continue to also implement the DOM 
<code>Node</code> interface, so you can still use DOM methods by casting the concrete node object to a DOM class.</i></p>

<p>The NodeInfo object provides the application with
information about the node. The most commonly-used methods include:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP">getItemType()</td>
    <td>gets a short identifying the node type (for example, element or attribute). The values are
     consistent with those used in the DOM, and are referenced by constants in the class
     <code>net.sf.saxon.value.Type</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="30%">getDisplayName(), getLocalName(), getPrefix(), getURI()</td>
    <td>These methods get the name of the element, or its various parts. The getDisplayName()
    method returns the QName as used in the original source XML.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP">getAttributeValue()</td>
    <td>get the value of a specified attribute, as a String.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP">getStringValue()</td>
    <td>get the string value of a node, as defined in the XPath data model</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP">getParent()</td>
    <td>get the NodeInfo representing the parent element, (which will be a <code>DocumentInfo</code> object
     if this is the outermost element).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP">getEnumeration()</td>
    <td>returns an SequenceIterator object that can be used to iterate over the nodes on any of the
    XPath axes. The first argument is an integer identifying the axis; the second is a <code>NodeTest</code> (a
    simple form of pattern) which can be used to filter the nodes on the axis. Supply <code>AnyNodeTest.getInstance()</code>
    if you want all the nodes on the axis. (For most applications, it is probably simpler to navigate
    from a node by compiling an XPath expression, and executing it with the correct starting node as
    the context node).</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<!--
<p><i>Note: The Java API was provided in Saxon long before the XSLT interface. Most of the things
that the Java API was designed to do can now be done more conveniently in XSL. Reflecting this,
some of the features of the API have been withdrawn as redundant, and the focus in Saxon will
increasingly be on doing everything possible through XSLT. <b>The new <a href="#Expressions">API for
invoking XPath</a>, however, is designed to make Saxon's XPath engine available to non-XSLT applications.</b></i></p>

<p>The Java processing model in Saxon is an extension of the XSLT processing model:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can evaluate XPath expressions to return sequences of nodes or other values, and
manipulate the results in your application code</li>
<li>You can write node handlers for elements and other nodes in the
 document, and you can specify the rules that associate a particular handler with
  particular elements or
other nodes. These rules are expressed as XSLT-compatible patterns. The node handlers are
analogous to XSLT template rules.</li>
<li>Within a node handler, you can select other nodes (typically but not necessarily
the immediate children) for processing. You can call applyTemplates() to invoke the appropriate
handler for each selected node. Alternatively, you can use Saxon API calls to navigate directly
to other nodes in the document, either directly, or using XPath expressions.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a Java node handler is invoked, it is provided with information about the node via
a <b>NodeInfo</b> object (usually you will be processing element nodes, in which case the
NodeInfo will be an <b>ElementInfo</b> object). The node handler is also given information
about the processing context, and access to a wide range of processing services, via an
<b>XSLTContext</b> object.</P>

<p>The NodeInfo object allows navigation around the tree.
It also provides facilities to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>determine the node's name, string-value, 
       and attributes as defined in the XPath tree model</li>
  <li>copy the node to the result tree</li>
  <li>navigate to other nodes using any of the XPath axes
</ul>

<p>The two basic Saxon tree structures, the standard tree and the tiny tree, both
implement DOM interfaces as well as Saxon's own NodeInfo interface. However, Saxon will
work with other tree structures that implement only the NodeInfo interface: one such
structure is the Saxon JDOM Adapter, which provides a Saxon interface to a JDOM tree.
(For more information about JDOM, see <a href="http://www.jdom.org/">http://www.jdom.org/</a>.)</p>

<p>The XSLTContext object allows a node handler to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>access any parameters associated with the applyTemplates() call that invoked this
    node handler</li>
    <li>get information about the current node list (the list of nodes being processed by this
    handler: for example, to determine if this is the last node in the list)</li>
    <li>evaluate XPath expressions</li>
    <li>get rapid access to nodes based on registered keys and identifiers</li>
    <li>declare and reference variables</li>
    <li>set an output destination for output from this node or its children (useful when
    splitting an XML document heirarchically) </li>
    <li>write output to the current destination </li>
</ul>
    

<h3>The Saxon API: comparison with SAX and DOM</h3>

<p>There are two standard APIs for processing XML documents: the SAX interface, and the DOM. SAX 
 (see <a HREF="http://www.megginson.com/SAX/index.html">http://www.megginson.com/SAX/index.html</a>)
is an event-driven interface in which the parser reports things such as start and end tags to the
 application as they are encountered, while the Document Object Model (DOM) (see 
<a HREF="http://www.w3.org/dom">http://www.w3.org/dom</a>
is a navigational interface in which the application
can roam over the document in memory by following relationships between its nodes. Another API,
JDOM, is similar in concept to DOM but provides a lighter-weight API that is more closely
integrated with the standard Java 2 classes.</p>

<p>Saxon offers a higher-level processing model than either SAX or DOM. It allows applications
to be written using a rule-based design pattern, in which your application consists of a set of rules
of the form "when this condition is encountered, do this processing". It is an event-condition-action
model in which the events are the syntactic constructs of XML, the conditions are XSLT-compatible
 patterns, and the actions are Java methods. Further, the action taken when these rules are fired
 may include evaluation of XPath expressions, providing a higher-level access mechanism than
 raw navigation of the tree.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with SAX, some of the differences in Saxon are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can provide a separate handler for each element type (or other node),
     making your application more modular </li>
  <li>Saxon supplies context information to your application, so you can find out, for
    example, the parent element of the one you are currently processing </li>
  <li>Saxon provides facilities for organizing the output of your application, allowing you to
    direct different parts of the output to different files. Saxon is a particularly
    convenient tool for splitting a large document into page-sized chunks for viewing, or into
    individual records for storing in a relational or object database.</li>
  <li>Saxon allows you to register your preferred SAX-compliant XML parser; you do not need to
    hard-code the name of the parser into your application or supply it each time on the
    command line. Saxon also works with several DOM implementations.</li>
  <li>Saxon extends the SAX InputSource class allowing you to specify a file name as the
    source of input. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Serial and Direct processing: preview mode</h3>

<p><i>An early release of Saxon allowed a purely serial mode of processing: each node
was processed as it was encountered. With experience, this proved too restrictive, and caused
the internal architecture to become too complex, so it was withdrawn. It has been replaced with
a new facility, <b>preview mode</b>. This is available both with XSL and with the Java API.</i></p>

<p>Preview mode is useful where the document is too large to fit comfortably in main memory. It
allows you to define node handlers that are called as the document tree is being built in memory,
rather than waiting until the tree is fully built which is the normal case.</p>

<p>When you define an element as a preview element (using the setPreviewElement() method of the
PreviewManager class), its node handler is called as soon as the element end tag is encountered. When the node handler returns control
to Saxon, the children of the preview element are discarded from memory.</p>

<p>This means, for example, that if your large XML document consists of a large number of chapters,
you can process each chapter as it is read, and the memory available needs to be enough only for
 (a) the largest individual chapter, and (b) the top-level structure identifying the list of chapters.</P

<p>When the document tree has been fully built, the node handler for its root element will be called
in the normal way.</p>

-->
<a NAME="Parser">
<h2>Building the Source Document</h2>
</a>

<p>The first thing the application must do is to build the source document, in the form of a tree.
The simplest approach is to use the sequence:</p> 

<p>
<table border="1" width="100%" class="code">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#00FFFF"><pre><code>
        String systemId = new File(sourceFile).toURL().toString();
        DocumentInfo doc = new XPathEvaluator().setSource(
                             new SAXSource(new InputSource(systemId)));
    <code></pre></td>
  </tr></table></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the JAXP 1.1 interface. For example:</p>

<p>
<table border="1" width="100%" class="code">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#00FFFF"><pre><code>
        System.setProperty("javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory",
             "net.sf.saxon.om.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl");
        DocumentBuilderFactory dfactory =
            DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();

        dfactory.setNamespaceAware(true);

        DocumentBuilder docBuilder = dfactory.newDocumentBuilder();
        
        String systemId = new File(sourceFile).toURL().toString();
        Node doc = docBuilder.parse(new InputSource(systemId));
    <code></pre></td>
  </tr></table></p>
  

<p>You can define the parser to be used by supplying a parser within the <code>SAXSource</code> object
supplied to the <code>Builder.build()</code> method. If you don't supply a parser, Saxon will select one
using the JAXP mechanisms, specifically, the system property <code>javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory</code>.
</p>

<p>If you want to use different parsers depending on the URI of the document being read,
you can achieve this by writing a <code>URIResolver</code> that nominates the parser to be used for each
input file.</p>

<a NAME="Controller">
<h2>Event-based Processing: the Controller</h2>
</a>

<p>If you want to use Saxon's event-based processing from a Java application, or other XSLT-like features
such as keys, or if you want to produce a result tree and perhaps serialize it, then you will need 
to create a <code>Controller</code>. The <code>Controller</code> class
is Saxon's implementation of the JAXP <code>javax.xml.transform.Transformer</code> interface.</p>

<p>Some of the functions of this class are
relevant only to XSLT transformation, but most can also be used when Saxon is used purely from Java.
Each application run must instantiate a new <code>Controller</code>.</p>


<p>There are several classes used to define the kind of processing you want to perform. These
are the RuleManager for registering template rules, the KeyManager for registering key definitions,
the PreviewManager for registering preview elements, the Stripper for registering which elements
are to have whitespace nodes stripped, and the DecimalFormatManager for registering named decimal
formats. These classes can all be reused freely, and they are thread safe once the definitions
have been set up. All of these objects are registered with the Controller using methods such as
setRuleManager() and setKeyManager().</p>


 <p>The Controller class is used to process a document tree by applying registered node handlers.
 Its main method is run(). The controller is responsible for navigating through the
document and calling user-defined handlers which you associate with each element or other node
type to define how it is to be processed. The controller can also be serially reused, but should not be used to
 process more than one document at a time. The Controller needs to know about the RuleManager to
 find the relevant node handlers to invoke. If keys are used it will need to know about the
 KeyManager, and if decimal formats are used it will need to know about the DecimalFormatManager.
 These classes can be registered with the Controller using setRuleManager(), setKeyManager(), and
 setDecimalFormatManager() respectively. If preview mode is used, the PreviewManager will need
 to know about the Controller, so it has a setController() method for this purpose.</p>






<a NAME="NodeHandler">
<h2>Writing and Registering a Node Handler</h2>
</a>

<p>You can register a node handlers that will be called to process each node,
 in the same way as template rules are used in XSLT.
They node handler can choose whether or not subsidiary elements should
be processed (by calling applyTemplates()), and can
dive off into a completely different part of the document tree before resuming. A user-written
node handler must implement the <b>NodeHandler</b> interface.</p>

<p>To register a node handler, create a <b>RuleManager</b>, register the node handler with it
using its <b>setHandler()</b> method, and regsiter the RuleManager with the Controller by calling
the Controller's <b>setRuleManager()</b> method.</p>

<p>Always remember that if you want child elements to be processed recursively, your
node handler must call the <b>applyTemplates()</b> method.</p>

<p>A node handler can write to the current output destination.
The controller maintains a current outputter. Your node handler can switch
output to a new destination by calling <b>changeOutputDestination()</b>, and can revert to the previous
destination by calling resetOutputDestination(). This is useful both for splitting an input XML
document into multiple XML documents, and for creating output fragments that can be
reassembled in a different order for display. Details of the output format required must be
set up in a Properties object, which is supplied as a parameter to changeOutputDestination().
</p>

<p>The node handler is supplied with an <b>NodeInfo</b> object which provides information
about the current node, and with a <b>Context</b> object that gives access to a range of standard services
such an Outputter object which includes a write() method to produce output.</p>

<p>Normally you will write one node handler for each type of element, but it is quite
possible to use the same handler for several different elements. You can also write
completely general-purpose handlers. You define which elements will be handled by each
element handler using a pattern, exactly as in XSLT.</p>

<p>You only need to provide one method for the selected node type. This is:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP" width="25%">start()</td>
    <td>This is called when the node is encountered in the tree. The NodeInfo object
    passed gives you information about the relevant node. You can save information
    for later use if required, using one of several techniques: <ul>
      <li>The setUserData() interface in the Controller object allows you to associate arbitrary
        information with any node in the source document. This is useful if you are building up an object model from the XML document, and
        you want to link XML elements to objects in your model.  </li>
      <li>You can save information in local variables within the node handler object:
        but take care not to do this if the same node handler might
      be used to process another element before the first one ends.</li>
      <li>Finally, you can create XSL variables using the Context object. These variables are visible
      only within the current node handler, but the ability to reference them in XPath expressions
      gives added flexibility. For example, you can set up a variable which is then used in a filter
      in the expression passed to applyTemplates(), which thus controls which child nodes will be
      processed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>



<a NAME="Patterns">
<h2>Patterns</h2>
</a>

<p>Patterns are used in the setHandler() interface to define which
nodes a particular handler applies to. Patterns 
used in the Saxon Java API have exactly the same form as in XSLT.</p>


<p>The detailed rules for patterns can be found in <a href=patterns.html>patterns.html</a>.</p>

<p>Patterns are represented in the API by the class <b>net.sf.saxon.pattern.Pattern</b>
respectively. It operates in much the same way as the <b>Expression</b> class introduced earlier.
There is a static method to create a Pattern from a String, and a method <b>matches()</b> that tests
whether a particular node matches a pattern.</p>

<p>When you create a Pattern using the method Pattern.make()
you must supply a StaticContext object. This object provides the information needed to interpret
certain patterns: for example, it provides the ability to convert a namespace
prefix within the expressions into a URI. In an XSLT stylesheet, the StaticContext provides information
the expression can get from the rest of the stylesheet; in a Java application, this is not available,
so you must provide the context yourself. If you don't supply a StaticContext object, a default context
is used: this will prevent you using context-dependent constructs such as variables and namespace prefixes.
