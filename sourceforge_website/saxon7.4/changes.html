<H1>Changes in this Release</H1>

<p>This file describes changes for versions 7.0 and later.
For changes prior to version 7.0,
see <a href="http://saxon.sf.net/saxon6.5.2/changes.html"/>http://saxon.sf.net/saxon6.5.2/changes.html</a>.</p>

<!-- carried over for 7.5:
<p>To be done:

** saxon:evaluate()
** assess performance impact of compilation
** add tracing of variable declarations
** add tracing of output events
** positional ParameterSet for namedTemplates and function calls
** Controller to act as an XPathContext
** combine evaluate() and iterate() (make SequenceIterator a Value, get rid of SequenceIntent)
** collations lock stylesheet tree into memory
** Combine ItemChecker with NodeChecker in sort package. 
** Work needed on Java extension functions, to do static type checking, less type conversion, etc.
** lazyEvaluate is rather nasty, try to get rid of it (or use it less)
** add non-string grouping keys
** Not all expressions currently promote their subexpressions.
** run-time reduction is still done for sort keys. The answer here is to build a SortedExpression that
sorts the result of the "select" expression, and rewrite this statically.

<H2>Changes in version 7.4 (2003-02-15) </H2>

<p><i>The theme for this release is strong typing. Saxon does not yet support user-defined types, and
has very limited facilities for supporting type annotations on nodes in the data model, but it does 
support most of the built-in atomic types in XML Schema, such as string, integer, decimal, double,
date, dateTime, duration, QName, and anyURI. This release introduces the stronger rules for type
checking of operations applied to values of these types. If you want strong type checking, set
<code>version="2.0"</code> on the stylesheet; if you are more concerned with backwards compatibility,
set <code>version="1.0"</code>.</i></p>

<h3>Defects cleared</h3>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=655725&group_id=29872&atid=397617">655725</a> - 
Java ClassCastException occurs when executing a positional filter expression of the form
<code>$x[position() &gt; 1]</code>.</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=655948&group_id=29872&atid=397617">655948</a> - 
Orphaned namespace declarations can appear when serializing a result tree using <code>method="text"</code>.</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=655950&group_id=29872&atid=397617">655950</a> - 
The <code>-a</code> option on the command line does not work.</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=656857&group_id=29872&atid=397617">656857</a> - 
The <code>xsl:analyze-string</code> instruction does not work correctly when no match is found.</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=659064&group_id=29872&atid=397617">659064</a> - 
A ClassCastException can occur when an extension function returns a value of class <code>java.util.List</code>.
(The clearance for this introduces a new facility: an extension function can now return a Java List, 
which will be converted to an XPath sequence, each item in the list being converted from a Java object
to an XPath value independently).</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=680755&group_id=29872&atid=397617">680755</a> - 
With the XML output method, indentation should be suppressed when the result tree contains <code>xml:space="preserve"</code>.</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=682979&group_id=29872&atid=397617">682979</a> - 
An UnsupportedOperationException occurs when a stylesheet function is called from the <code>return</code>
clause of a <code>for</code> expression.</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=684487&group_id=29872&atid=397617">684487</a> - 
Double values less than 0.001 are incorrectly converted to strings: a trailing zero is added (for example,
"0.00030").</p>

<p>The following defect has not been fixed, and is carried over until a future release:</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=655730&group_id=29872&atid=397617">655730</a> -
HTML elements in a non-null namespace are serialized as if they were in the null namespace;
they should be serialized as XML.</p>

<h3>XSLT changes</h3>

<p>The context item, position, and size are now unset on entry to a stylesheet function. This means that
if the function depends on the context item (or the document containing the context item), 
then an explicit parameter must be defined. For example, if the function defines <code>&lt;xsl:result select="count(//*)"/&gt;</code>,
this must be changed to <code>&lt;xsl:result select="count($x//*)"/&gt;</code>, with <code>$x</code> being
supplied as a parameter in the function call. If the function attempts to reference the context item,
position, or size, a dynamic error is reported.</p>

<p>This change gives optimization benefits in all cases where functions are NOT dependent on the context.</p>

<p>The <code>value</code> attribute of <code>&lt;xsl:number&gt;</code> is now handled as described in the
XSLT 2.0 specification: the value may be a sequence, and the items in the sequence are converted to integers
using the casting rules. A recoverable error occurs if casting to an integer is not possible, or
if the value is not positive. {numb07, numb20}</p>

<p>A side-effect of this change is that a user-written <code>Numberer</code> must be changed to handle a <code>long</code>
argument rather than an <code>int</code> as previously.</p>

<p>The code for assignment of variables and parameters has been changed to use the argument conversion
rules defined in XPath (without backwards compatibility mode). This is a weaker conversion than previously:
essentially, the <code>select</code> expression must deliver a value of the correct type, it will not be converted
to the required type except in the case where the supplied value is an untyped node. This means, for example,
that if the required type is <code>xs:integer</code>, you can supply an attribute node, but you cannot supply
a string or a double.
If a cast to the required type is wanted, it must now be written explicitly in the select expression. The error
will be reported statically if the expression could never yield a value of the right type, and will be reported
dynamically otherwise.</p>

<p>In a pattern starting <code>key('k', $x)/...</code>, the variable <code>$x</code> can now be multi-valued; 
the pattern matches if it matches any of the values. {idky30}</p>

<p>The XSLT 1.0 rule that <code>xsl:text</code> elements may not contain child elements has been 
reinstated. This change anticipates changes to the XSLT 2.0 specification.</p>

<p>In limited circumstances, stylesheet functions (<code>xsl:function</code>) now optimise tail-recursion.
The circumstances are that the <code>select</code> expression of the <code>xsl:result</code> instruction
must contain a call on the same function in the <code>then</code> or <code>else</code> part of a
conditional expression (which may be nested in further conditional expressions). It may require a little
care to write functions to exploit this.</p>

<p>The attribute <code>override=yes|no</code> on <code>xsl:function</code> is implemented. 
This determines whether a user-written
stylesheet function should override a vendor-supplied or user-written Java function. The default is "yes".
{func19, func21}</p>

<p><i>This involved taking the function binding logic out of the ExpressionParser and putting it all in the
static context. A simpler version of the routine is provided for StandaloneContext. The code has
been structured so it can also test for arity (or even static type of arguments) as part of the binding
algorithm, but this is not yet exploited.</i></p>

<p>A side-effect of this change is that it is now possible to call Saxon and EXSLT extension functions
when using free-standing XPath expressions, that is, expressions executed using the XPath API from Java,
or using saxon:evaluate(). It is also possible to call user-supplied Java extension functions
provided the URI maps implicitly to a Java class name (i.e., not relying on <code>saxon:script</code>).
{saxon36, 37}</p>

<p>Sorting using <code>xsl:sort</code>: I have changed the way data types are specified (in anticipation
of changes to the W3C specification). The <code>data-type</code> attribute may now take
values <code>text</code> or <code>number</code> only. 
The values <code>text</code> and <code>number</code> convert the actual sort
key to <code>xs:string</code> or <code>xs:double</code> respectively before doing the comparison. 
If the <code>data-type</code> attribute is omitted there
is no conversion. Values are then compared as supplied; if they are not comparable, a run-time error occurs.
If you want to force conversion to a type such as <code>xs:dateTime</code>, use a casting function within 
the <code>select</code> expression, for example <code>&lt;xsl:sort select="xs:date(@birth-date)"/&gt;</code>.
There is a small risk of backwards incompatibility if your stylesheet computes a numeric sort key and doesn't specify
a data-type: previously it would have been sorted as a string, it will now be sorted as a number.</p>

<p>I added a check (really a bug fix for 7.3) that when an element is annotated with a simple type
such as <code>xs:integer</code>, the element is not allowed to have attributes. The type annotation for an element
with attributes must always be a complex type.</p> 

<h3>XPath changes</h3>

<p>The type conversion rules as defined in the XPath 2.0 working draft are now implemented. This means that
the rules for passing arguments to functions and operators are now stricter: you can't simply assume that the
supplied value will be cast to the required type.</p>

<p>The rules are stricter if the stylesheet specifies <code>version="2.0"</code> than if it specifies
<code>version="1.0"</code>. The <code>version</code> attribute (or <code>xsl:version</code> on a literal
result element) determines whether XPath 1.0 backwards compatibility mode is used for XPath expressions within
its scope. With backwards compatibility mode on, certain conversions that were permitted in XPath 1.0 (for example,
conversion of anything to a string or number, or extraction of the first item of a sequence) are still permitted
under XPath 2.0. With this mode off, these conversions must be done explicitly in the function call. The only 
conversions that happen automatically under 2.0 are extraction of the value from a node: if the node is untyped
(which with Saxon 7.4 will almost invariably be the case), the untyped value is then cast to the type required
by the function signature. This means you can supply an untyped attribute as an operand to the "+" oeprator or
the <code>round()</code> function, for example, but you cannot supply a string.</p>

<p>Division of two decimals (and also the <code>mod</code> operator) now produces a decimal. Previously it produced
a double. The scale of the resulting decimal (the number of digits after the decimal point) is equal to
the sum of the scales of the two decimals, plus 6. So, for example, 10.0 div 3 is 3.333333. There have
been some other refinements to the <code>xs:decimal</code> implementation. Insignificant trailing zeros are always
discarded. Conversion of a decimal to a string uses an integer representation if there is no fractional
part, for example the result of <code>10.0 div 5.0</code> is diplayed as <code>2</code> (which doesn't
match the current XPath specification).</p>

<p>Conversion of an empty sequence to a double now produces an empty sequence (not NaN as in XPath 1.0);
conversion of any other non-numeric string to a double raises an error (rather than producing NaN). This
follows the current XPath 2.0 specification.</p>

<p>I attempted to change the double-to-string conversion to fit the XPath 2.0 rules, but it hit numerous
compatibility problems so I have held back on this. But positive and negative infinity are now represented
as <code>INF</code> and <code>-INF</code> (previously they were <code>Infinity</code> and <code>-Infinity</code>).
The strings <code>INF</code> and <code>-INF</code> are also recognized when casting a string to a double or
float; XPath 1.0 had no way of constructing these values except by using a construct such as 
<code>(1 div 0)</code>. {math95, math96}</p> 


<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>The standard functions have been enhanced, where the spec requires it, to return an empty sequence if one of
their arguments is an empty sequence.</p>

<p>The <code>max()</code> and <code>min()</code> functions now handle any comparable type, 
returning the correct data type (for example, if given a set of integers, they return
an integer). The default (for untyped nodes) is string comparison. A collation can be specified as the 
second argument; if not specified, the default collation is used. {expr56, expr57, sort20, sort21, date065, error220}</p>

<p>The implementation of <code>deep-equal()</code>, <code>sequence-deep-equal()</code>, 
and <code>sequence-node-equal()</code> has been revised to
conform to the current specifications.</p>

<p>The <code>distinct-values()</code> function is now implemented, with an optional collation argument. {group017-019}</p>

<p>The functions <code>floor()</code>, <code>round()</code>, <code>ceiling()</code> now return a value of the same type as the supplied
argument. {math87-90}</p>

<p>The <code>index-of()</code> function now takes an optional collation argument. {expr87}</p>

<p>For functions that take a collation argument, such as <code>compare()</code>, the default if no
collation is specified in the call, and no default <code>&lt;saxon:collation&gt;</code> is supplied,
is to use code-point collation. This differs from previous releases, where the default was to use
a locale-dependent collation. For <code>xsl:sort</code>, the default is still locale-dependent.
This decision is likely to be reviewed in future.</p>

<p>The arguments of <code>sort()</code> are now reversed: the first argument is the sequence to be sorted, the
second is the name of the sort key specification.</p>

<p>Changed <code>sum()</code> and <code>avg()</code> to return the same type as supplied. The average of an empty sequence is
now (), not NaN. These functions are still confined to handling numeric values, they do not yet work
over other summable types such as durations. {math91, math92, expr55, error227} </p>

<p>Corrected a bug: conversion of a double to a float was returning a double!</p>

<p>The functions <code>starts-with()</code>, <code>contains()</code>, and <code>ends-with()</code> 
now accept a collation name as an optional second argument. {str126-128}</p>

<p>The functions <code>substring-before()</code> and <code>substring-after()</code> now accept 
a collation name as an optional second argument. {str129-130}</p>

<p>The <code>saxon:distinct()</code> function, with a single argument, is dropped: the functionality is available
using either the XPath 2.0 distinct-values() function, or the EXSLT <code>set:distinct()</code> function. The
two-argument form (which takes an expression as the second argument) remains.</p>

<p>The dynamic expression supplied to <code>saxon:expression</code> and <code>saxon:evaluate</code> can now
contain references to the variables <code>$p1</code>, <code>$p2</code>, ... <code>$p9</code>. The values of
these variables can be supplied when the expression is evaluated using <code>saxon:eval</code> or <code>saxon:evaluate</code>
respectively. The expression can also contain calls to Java extension functions bound using the implicit mapping
of Java classes to namespaces, and to Saxon and EXSLT extension functions. For more details see
 <a href="extensions.html">extensions.html</a>.</p>

<p>The function <code>saxon:get-user-data()</code> has changed to return an empty sequence rather than a zero-length
string if no data exists. This is to prevent type-checking problems when the expected value is not a
string. {saxon06}</p>

<p>The <code>error()</code> function (with optional argument) is implemented. If the argument is specified, its 
string-value is used as the error message. {error223-224}</p>

<p>The <code>node-name()</code> function is implemented. It returns a value of type <code>xs:QName</code>.</p>

<p>The functions <code>get-in-scope-namespaces()</code> and <code>get-namespace-uri-for-prefix()</code> are
implemented. {nspc45-46}</p>

<p>The <code>unparsed-entity-public-id()</code> function (defined in XSLT 2.0) is implemented. This required
a minor change to the <code>DocumentInfo</code> interface implemented by the tree model. {expr88}</p>

<p>The <code>unordered()</code> function is implemented. This returns the results of a sequence in
implementation-defined order. In practice the only important case where it has any effect in the Saxon
implementation is where the sequence supplied as argument is a Step using a reverse axis: for example,
unordered(ancestor::*) returns the ancestors in reverse document order. But applications should
not rely on the actual order; the function is intended to be used by applications that do not care about
the order of the results. {axes60}</p>

<p>A simple implementation of the <code>input()</code> function is available. If the parameter
<code>{http://saxon.sf.net/}input</code> has been supplied to the transformation, it returns the value
of this parameter. This must be a node sequence &emdash; which means it cannot be supplied from the 
command line. If no such parameter has been supplied, it returns the root of the principal source
document (the document containing the node that was matched on entry to the transformation).
{Limited testing only: mdocs09}</p>

<p>The <code>default-collation()</code> function is implemented: it returns the URI of the default
collation if specified, or the URI of the code-point collation otherwise.</p>

<p>The component extraction functions for durations are now available only on the two subtypes
<code>yearMonthDuration</code> and <code>dayTimeDuration</code>, and are named accordingly: 
for example <code>get-years-from-yearMonthDuration</code>
and <code>get-hours-from-dayTimeDuration</code>. (But other operations remain available on durations even though
not specified in the current working draft, for example equality comparison on durations). {date055-058}</p>

<p>Casts and constructor functions, when converting from a string to another type, now apply the appropriate
whitespace normalization to the supplied value, as defined in the whitespace facet for the target data
type. This means, for example, that an ID value can have leading and trailing spaces, which are ignored. {type035}</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>A new attribute <code>saxon:explain</code> is available on any instruction in the stylesheet. The permitted
values are "yes" and "no". If the value is yes, then at compile-time, Saxon outputs an analysis of all
XPath expressions appearing in attributes of that instruction. The analysis includes the static type
of the expression, and a representation of the optimized expression tree. For some examples, see
<a href="extensions.html#explain">extensions.html</a>.</p>

<p>A new command line option is available. The <code>-TJ</code> option traces the binding of external
calls to Java functions. It is useful when analyzing why Saxon fails to find a Java method to match
an extension function call in the stylesheet, or why it chooses one method over another when several
are available. The option is also available programmatically via the <code>TRACE_EXTERNAL_FUNCTIONS</code> attribute
 in the <code>TransformerFactory</code>.</p>
 
 <p>The URI <code>http://www.w3.org/2002/11/query-operators/collation/codepoint</code> is now recognized
 as the name of the code-point collation; if this URI is specified in calls to sorting or comparison
 operations, strings will be compared according to their Unicode code-points. Note that this URI
 is likely to change in subsequent versions of the XPath working drafts.</p>

<p>There has been a change to the mechanism whereby a <code>ContentHandler</code> that is nominated 
to handle the result tree can indicate
that it is prepared to handle output that is well-balanced, but not well-formed (for example, if it contains
more than one element node as a child of the document root). 
A new attribute <code>saxon:require-well-formed</code> is available on <code>xsl:output</code>, with
values "yes" or "no". The default is "no". If the value is set to "yes", and a user-written
<code>ContentHandler</code> is supplied to receive the results of the transformation, then Saxon will report an
error rather than sending a non-well-formed stream of SAX events to the <code>ContentHandler</code>.
{saxon72, error231}</p>

<p>The XML output method now outputs a tab character appearing in an attribute value as &amp;#x9;, to prevent
it being normalized when the document is re-parsed.{type035}</p>

<p>The XPath API has been extended with a method that allows the sort order for the results of an expression
to be specified. Previously, there was no way of sorting sequences except in an XSLT context, or by use
of rather complex internal Saxon classes. Expressions generated using the XPath API can also now be used
directly in conjunction with the <code>applyTemplates</code> mechanism in the <code>Controller</code>, for
use by applications doing rule-based processing from Java. The <code>getExpression</code> method of
<code>XPathExpression</code>, which provided an escape from the packaged XPath API into the internal 
Saxon interfaces, has been replaced by <code>rawIterator()</code>, which fulfils the same purpose.</p> 

<p>A Java extension function can now return a <code>java.util.List</code> object to represent a sequence.
Each item in the list is converted to an XPath value (node or atomic value) as if it were returned from
a separate function call: for example, a List containing three Java Integers is converted to an XPath
sequence of three <code>xs:int</code> values. {func25}</p>

<p>The interface that handles the setting of variables accessed by the XPath engine from its environment
has been generalized to remove the assumption that the variables are defined in XSLT. This means that
variables can now be used in the freestanding XPath API, as well as in <code>saxon:expression</code> and
<code>saxon:evaluate</code>.</p>

<p>I have removed the restriction that a URIResolver for the URI contained in the <code>href</code>
pseudo-attribute of the <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt;</code> processing instruction must return a SAXSource.
It can now return any kind of Source. This change has been regression tested only. The (existing) code for
creating a composite stylesheet when there are several <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt;</code> processing instructions,
(as specified in the JAXP interface definition) is not tested by any of my standard tests, but I have 
left it in. From an inspection of the code, I don't think it will work if the URIs are relative.</p>

<h3>Internal Changes</h3>

<p>These changes should not affect users unless you exploit internal interfaces within Saxon.</p>

<p>Parameters to stylesheet functions are now passed by position (in an array of values), not by
name.</p>

<p>Internally, there has been a change to the processing of literal result elements. XPath expressions
contained within attribute value templates on such an element are now processed during the first (prepareAttributes)
compilation phase, as with other stylesheet instructions. Type checking happens during the second (validate) phase. A
consequence of this change is that user-defined top-level elements are now represented by a different
class, DataElement, to prevent their attributes being processed as AVTs.</p>

<p>Changes made in support of XPath type-checking include the following:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The general trend is towards doing more of the work at compile time. Where type conversions are necessary,
or where it is determined statically that they might be necessary, then the conversions are compiled into the 
executable expression; if they are not necessary, they are not performed. 
Similarly, if dynamic type checking is necessary, then it is compiled into the expression; 
otherwise, it is not performed.</p></li>

<li><p>Function calls to standard functions are now compiled with knowledge of the signature of the function.
The code generated is conditional on whether backwards compatible mode is enabled or not. If the supplied
arguments are incompatible with the function signature (that is, if the call cannot possibly succeed) then
a static type error is generated. Code to atomize nodes and perform other allowed conversions (e.g. numeric
promotion) is compiled into the expression tree. If the supplied value cannot be statically guaranteed to be
of the correct type, then type-checking code is generated in the expression tree.</p></li>

<li><p>The same logic is used for calls to stylesheet functions. In this case, backwards compatible mode
is never used, which means there is no implicit conversion of arguments. Calls to stylesheet functions are
now statically checked; this is done by means of a fixup process that allows for the fact that the function call
can be parsed before the function declaration is encountered.</p></li>

<li><p>The same logic is used for evaluating keys.</p></li>

<li><p>Within the implementation of standard functions, arguments are now evaluated without 
any type conversion: any conversions that are performed are done by the function calling mechanism, 
using internal tables that represent the signatures of each function.</p></li>

<li><p>The internal <code>Expression#evaluate()</code> method has been dropped. 
All implementations and usages of this function have changed
to use <code>evaluateItem()</code> or <code>iterate()</code> (or in some cases, <code>lazyEvaluate()</code>), 
as appropriate.</p></li>

<li><p>The code for value comparisons and general comparisons has been split into a number separate classes.
 These do stricter type checking of their arguments. The decision which algorithm to use (hash join, etc)
 is now made at compile time, using static information about the types and cardinality of the arguments.
 But the conversion of untypedAtomic values (which result from atomizing a node with no type annotation) to
 a string or double (depending on the type of the other argument) is done dynamically. 
 <i>In the final stages of testing I found a design problem in this area: neither the new code nor
 the code in previous releases handled comparisons such as <code>(U, U, U) = (1, 2, '3')</code> correctly, where U
 is an untyped value. The problem here is that a mixture of string and numeric comparisons is required.
 I fixed this for the time being by changing the code so it always does a naive nested-loop comparison. This doesn't
 appear to have a noticable effect on performance in most cases: there will be some cases where
 it is very inefficient, but these don't arise very often.</i></p></li>

<li><p>Other classes, notably the code for arithmetic expressions, also
do stricter type checking.</p></li>

<li><p>The code for attribute value templates has been reorganized. The <code>AttributeValueTemplate</code> class is now
used only at compile time, and it has therefore been moved to the <code>style</code> package. It no longer acts as
a pseudo-XPath expression; instead, compiling the AVT generates a true XPath expression, including calls
to <code>concat()</code>, <code>string-join()</code>, and <code>string()</code> where required. 
These handle all necessary type conversions.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>Expression#evaluateAsString()</code> method no longer does conversion of the expression 
result to a string; the
method should only be used where (a) the expression is statically known to return a string or (), and (b)
the returned value of () is treated as equivalent to "". In practice, this means that the use of the method
is now largely confined to the evaluation of attribute value templates. This method will probably
be phased out.</p></li>

<li><p>The code for <code>xsl:value-of</code> has changed so it now compiles any code needed to convert the
supplied expression to a string (or, if the separator attribute is present, a sequence of strings)</p></li>

<li><p>The code for <code>xsl:sort</code> has changed so that the sort key is converted to the required type
using the same rules as the rules for function arguments. Internally, a new class <code>FixedSortKeyDefinition</code> is
introduced to represent a sort key definition that contains no context dependencies, that is, one in which
the values of all the parameters such as order, case-order, language, and data-type are known. Sometimes it is
possible to create this statically, sometimes (when AVTs are used) it cannot be created until the values of
variables are known.</p></li>

<li><p>Those Saxon extension functions that need special treatment at compile time (specifically, 
<code>saxon:evaluate</code>,
<code>saxon:expression</code>, <code>saxon:parse</code>, and <code>saxon:serialize</code>),
are now treated in the same way as system functions.</p></li>

<li><p>The class <code>SimpleValue</code> has been renamed <code>AtomicValue</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>The method <code>convert()</code> is now available only on the <code>AtomicValue</code> class, it is not available
for all values as previously. This method implements the logic of the casting rules.</p></li>

<li><p>Expressions are now parsed in three stages: parsing, context-independent rewriting, and static type
analysis. The first stage is done by the <code>ExpressionParser</code> class, the second by calling the <code>simplify()</code>
method on the resulting Expression object. The third stage is done by calling the <code>typeCheck()</code> method
on the Expression object. In an XSLT context, type information for stylesheet variables and stylesheet
functions is added before the <code>typeCheck()</code> method is called. The <code>Expression.make()</code> call
only does the first two steps; applications that use this interface must be changed to call typeCheck()
as well. The XPath API in package <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath</code> works unchanged.</p></li>

<li><p>Higher-order expressions, such as path expressions, filter expressions, and "for", "some", and "every"
expressions, are now rewritten statically to promote any subexpressions that don't depend on the iteration
variables. The effect is that such subexpressions are only evaluated once. This mechanism replaces the
previous run-time optimisation based on the concept of expression reduction (at run-time, the expression
was replaced with an expression in which the independent sub-expressions were replaced with their value).
The new mechanism is done entirely at compile time and is therefore much more economical. Also it avoids
doing trivial rewrites, that is, extracting constants and simple variable references.{opt001-004}</p></li>

<li><p>Run-time expression reduction is still used to eliminate context dependencies in an expression that is being
evaluated lazily (always an expression that returns a sequence), and is being held as the value
of a variable. When evaluation of such an expression is deferred, it is necessary to make a copy of 
all aspects of the context that it depends on, and this is done by rewriting the expression with a 
new expression in which all context variables are replaced with their values.</p></li>

The <code>&lt;saxon:query&gt;</code> extension element throws a NullPointerException if the <code>columns</code>
attribute is omitted</p>

<h3>Performance improvements</h3>

<p>The code for <code>&lt;xsl:number level="any"&gt;</code> has been optimized. The conditions that must apply 
for this optimization are
that the count and from patterns must not contain any variable references; either the count pattern must
be specified, or the name and type of the context node must be statically obtainable, typically from
the match pattern of the containing template rule. Under these circumstances, Saxon will remember the 
result of evaluating the instruction, and the next time it is evaluated, if the first node encountered
in its reverse scan of the document is the one that was most recently numbered, it will simply add one
to the remembered number.</p>

<p><i>Note: a similar optimization for <code>&lt;xsl:number&gt;</code> with no attributes has been
in use for some time.</i></p>

<p>The numbering code also now passes down the required node name and kind to the axis iterator 
that is used to find the nodes being
counted. This reduces the overhead of skipping non-matching nodes.</p>

<p>The code for navigating the parent and ancestor axes in the TinyTree implementation has been improved.
The next pointer for the last sibling now points to the parent node; this is distinguished from a normal next
pointer by virtue of the fact that it always points backwards in the node array. When a search is needed to find
the parent, this is now done by reading the next-sibling pointer chain until the owner is found, which in
general is faster than the previous technique, of scanning all preceding nodes until one is found whose depth
is lower.</p>

<p><i>This was done after exploring a number of alternative approaches, none of which led to significant
performance improvements. In particular, I tried various ways of remembering the parent node during a scan
of the descendant axis, but in all cases the benefit achieved when the parent node was actually used was less than
the extra cost of maintaining the information in the cases where it wasn't needed.</i></p>

<p><i>Note: I have not identified any circumstances in which the "standard" tree implementation out-performs
the TinyTree. The "standard" implementation is retained, however, because it is used for stylesheets during
compilation.</i></p>

<p>A small improvement has been made to the code for evaluating an attribute reference.</p>

<p>Various expression classes now contain their own implementations of the effectiveBooleanValue() method,
avoiding the need to use the general-purpose logic in cases where the value is already known to be a singleton.</p>

<p>My main test case for these performance improvements was the stylesheet used to render the XSLT 2.0 specification.
The execution time for this stylesheet improved from 16.4 seconds to 7.6 seconds. Improvements for other stylesheets
are very unlikely to be as high as this. Another test case improved from 66.8 to 59.8 seconds, which is probably more
typical.</p>

<!-- not included because code was untested
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>If an extension function returns a value that is an instance of <code>java.util.List</code>, and the
list contains things that are not instances of <code>saxon.sf.net.om.Item</code>, Saxon will now treat
the List as being an external object, which may be passed on to other extension functions. Previously
it would fail reporting that the result value could not be converted. Note that when an empty List is
returned, it is always interpreted as an XPath empty sequence. [Suggestion from Gunther Schadow]</p>

<h3>XSLT changes</h3>

<p>The <code>xsl:principal-result-document</code> element is withdrawn.
Note, however, that the ability to NOT have a principal result tree is not yet available.
A principal output file will be created even if it is empty.</p>

<p>Attributes of <code>xsl:output</code> can no longer be attribute value templates.</p>

<p>A new attribute has been added to <code>xsl:output</code>: <code>saxon:byte-order-mark="yes"</code>
causes a byte order mark (hex FEFF) to be inserted at the start of the output file. This is most
useful with UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoding, as some text editors recognize it, but it is available for
use with any output method and any encoding. {outp70}</p>

<p>The <code>saxon:omit-meta-tag</code> attribute in <code>xsl:output</code> has been replaced with the
new (standard) <code>include-content-type</code> attribute. Note that this works the other way around:
replace <code>saxon:omit-meta-tag="yes"</code> by <code>include-content-type="no"</code>.
{saxon47, outp71}</p>

<p>The new (standard) <code>escape-uri-attributes</code> attribute in <code>xsl:output</code> has
been implemented for the HTML output method. (URI escaping is not yet implemented for method="xhtml").
{outp71}</p>

<p>The built-in template rules now pass parameters through unchanged to the templates for their child
elements. This applies whether the rule is called because of <code>xsl:apply-templates</code> 
or <code>xsl:apply-imports</code> {cnfr21, cnfr22}.</p>

<p>The base URI of the root of a temporary tree is now taken from the base URI of the <code>xsl:variable</code>
element in the stylesheet. Previously it was taken from the system ID. There is a difference in the case
where xml:base is used. {not tested}</p>

<p>A variable that is never referenced will no longer be evaluated. This can cause problems if evaluation
of the variable has side-effects (e.g. by calling an extension function, or <code>saxon:assign</code>). You
can force evaluation of the variable by setting <code>saxon:assignable="yes"</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>terminate</code> attribute of <code>xsl:message</code> may now be an attribute value
template. {ver14}</p>

<p>The <code>copy-namespaces</code> attribute of <code>xsl:copy</code> and <code>xsl:copy-of</code> is
now supported. {copy12-13}</p>

<p>The <code>type</code> attribute of <code>xsl:variable</code>, <code>xsl:param</code>,
and <code>xsl:result</code> is renamed <code>as</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>as</code> and <code>collation</code> attributes of <code>xsl:key</code> are now supported.
This allows indexing of nodes by numeric or date values, and matching using case-blind or accent-blind comparisons.
{idky25-29}.</p>

<p>The <code>type-annotation</code> attribute of <code>xsl:attribute</code> and <code>xsl:element</code>
and the <code>xsl:type-annotation</code> of literal result elements are supported. For example, you
can now annotate attributes of elements on a temporary tree as <code>type-annotation="xs:ID"</code>, and 
then use the <code>id()</code> function to find them, using an expression such as <code>$tree/id('A001')</code>.
The actual value of the element or attribute must be valid according the the type given in the type annotation. Only built-in
schema-defined types are currently supported. Attribute types derived from a DTD will be recorded if they
are reported by the parser (but CDATA is treated as untyped, and the list types IDREFS, ENTITIES, and NMTOKENS
are not yet supported). Although the values must be valid according to their type, there are no checks on 
uniqueness constraints (ID) or referential integrity constraints (IDREF). {schema001-4}</p>

<p>The type annotations are retained on the tree only if the attribute <code>type-information="preserve"</code>
is present. If the attribute is absent, or is set to <code>none</code>, the type-annotation on any
elements or attributes in the tree will still be used to validate the content, but will not result
in any annotation of the nodes on the tree. The values <code>strict</code> and <code>lax</code>
for this attribute are not yet implemented. {schema005-6}</p>

<p>The <code>type-information</code> attribute is also available on <code>xsl:result-document</code>.
It only affects the outcome if the result tree is captured using a user-written <code>Receiver</code> in which
the annotations will be available. At present the type annotations are NOT retained if
the result is fed into another stylesheet using
<code>saxon:next-in-chain</code>: this is because the chaining goes via a SAX2 ContentHandler
which cannot pass the type information through. {schema007, schema013}</p>

<p>The attribute <code>copy-type-annotations</code> is available on <code>xsl:copy-of</code>. The default
is "no", which means that type annotations are NOT copied from the source tree to the result tree.
{schema011-012}</p> 

<p>The effect of <code>xsl:namespace-alias</code> has been changed. Elements and attributes whose namespace
is changed by an <code>xsl:namespace-alias</code> declaration will now take the prefix given in
the <code>result-prefix</code> attribute, where possible. Previously they took the new namespace URI
but retained their original prefix. This was technically conformant with the specification, but untidy,
and it often led to the result document containing multiple declarations
of the same namespace URI. {nspc36-38}</p>

<p>Conflicting <code>xsl:namespace-alias</code> declarations are now reported as a static error.
{error007}</p>

<h3>XPath changes</h3>

<p>The precedence of different expressions in the XPath grammar has been aligned with the August 2002
working draft. This meant making a few changes: range expressions (such as <code>1 to 10</code>) now bind more
tightly than conditional expressions; all comparison operators now have the same precedence, and consecutive
operators (as in <code>a = b = c</code>) are not allowed; unary minus binds more tightly than union; 
cast and treat expressions are no longer allowed as steps in a path expression. Saxon implements
the full XPath 2.0 grammar with the exceptions of the <code>validate</code> expression and schema-related
aspects of the <code>SequenceType</code> production.</p>

<p>Removed the ability to do a "mapping cast", that is, to cast a sequence as a sequence. This functionality
went beyond the semantics of cast as defined in the XPath 2.0 specification. The argument and
result of a cast must now be a singleton, and if the input is an empty sequence, the output is an empty
sequence. The actual conversion rules still need some work to align them fully with the evolving XPath
specification.</p>

<p>Implemented the <code>escape-uri()</code> function. The '#' character is treated as a reserved character, in addition
to those listed in the specification. {expr85}</p>

<p>Implemented the <code>item-at()</code> function, but with restrictions: if the subscript is out of range, it should
raise an error, but it currently returns the empty sequence. {pos65}</p>

<p>Implemented the <code>data()</code> function. {schema008, 009, 010, 012}</p>

<p>The concept of "effective boolean value" has been implemented. This algorithm 
 is now used when converting any value to a boolean
in contexts such as conditional expressions, filter predicates, and the <code>boolean()</code> function. It is
fully backwards compatible with XPath 1.0.</p>

<p>A different,
more restricted algorithm is used when casting values to booleans using a cast expression or the <code>xs:boolean()</code>
constructor: for strings in particular, the effective boolean value gives false for a zero-length string
and true for any other string, while <code>xs:boolean()</code> (in line with W3C Schema) gives true for "1" or "true",
false for "0" or "false", and an error for any other string. {type034}
<i><code>xs:boolean()</code> changes are not yet complete for supplied values other than string.</i></p>

<p>The algorithm for "atomize" is also available for all expressions, though at present it is used only
for the argument of a cast. It is also simpler than the algorithm described in the specification because
at present the typed value of a node is always the same as the string value.</p>

<p>Changed the EXSLT <code>set:leading()</code> and <code>set:trailing()</code> functions (as required by the spec) so that if the second
argument is empty, the first argument is returned. Changed <code>saxon:before()</code> and <code>saxon:after()</code> so they work the 
same way. Previously, the empty node-set was returned. This change will be retrofitted to 6.5.x. There is a further
deviation from the spec: If no node in the second node-set is present in the first node-set, Saxon 
returns all nodes before/after the first/last in the second node-set, whereas the spec requires it to return
an empty sequence. This would require a redesign, and it prevents a pipelined implementation, so I don't intend
to implement this change.</p>

<p>Implemented the <code>string-to-codepoints()</code> and <code>codepoints-to-string()</code> functions,
 replacing <code>saxon:string-to-unicode()</code>
and <code>saxon:unicode-to-string()</code>. {saxon68-69}</p>

<p>Implemented the <code>string-join()</code> function. {str125}</p>

<p>Implemented the <code>castable as</code> operator. {type030}</p>

<p>Implemented the types <code>xs:anyURI</code> and <code>xs:QName</code>, and the functions <code>expanded-QName()</code>, 
<code>get-local-name-from-QName()</code>, <code>get-namespace-from-QName()</code> {type031-33}</p>

<p>Implemented the SequenceType grammar for "attribute of type T" and "element of type T". T must be
a built-in simple type. {schema002-004, 014; error009, 012}.</p>

<p>The second argument of <code>saxon:serialize()</code> must now be known at compile-time. This is because details
of xsl:output declarations are not available at run-time unless they are actually referenced.</p>

<p>The results of the <code>function-available()</code> and <code>element-available()</code> functions may be inaccurate
if the argument is not known at compile-time. Specifically, only system-defined functions and
instructions are known at run-time. In practice, these functions are designed to perform compile-time
tests so this is very unlikely to be a problem. There is also some justification in that the only
functions that can be called dynamically (using <code>saxon:evaluate()</code>) are system-defined functions.</p>

<p>As a result of the changes affecting stylesheet compilation, there are some new restrictions on
the extension function <code>saxon:evaluate()</code> (and also <code>saxon:expression()</code>). In particular, the dynamically
constructed expression can no longer reference any XSLT variables, and it cannot access any stylesheet
functions, Saxon extension functions, or XSLT-specific functions such as <code>key()</code> and <code>generate-id()</code>.</p>

<h3>Stylesheet Compilation</h3>

<p>There has been a substantial change to the way stylesheets are "compiled". In previous releases, the
compiled stylesheet was actually a standard tree representation of the source XML stylesheet, with annotations
on the nodes to assist efficient execution. In this release, the tree representation of the stylesheet is
discarded once compilation is complete, and a custom data structure is used to represent the executable
stylesheet.</p>

<p>The compiled stylesheet may now be serialized (using Java serialization), enabling it to be saved on
disk, or transferred between machines - this is especially useful in an Enterprise Java Beans environment.
A new command <code>java net.sf.saxon.Compile <i>stylesheet</i> <i>output</i></code> is available to
compile a stylesheet, and the <code>java net.sf.saxon.Transform</code> command has a new option <code>-c</code>
which causes the stylesheet parameter to be taken as a compiled stylesheet rather than a source
stylesheet. In fact, using compiled stylesheets from the command line does not give a great performance
advantage over recompiling them each time they are used, because the compilation time is dominated by 
Java initialization; the benefits are more likely to be realized in
a high-throughput server-based environment, where it is now possible to use disk caching of stylesheets as
an alternative to in-memory caching.</p>

<p>These changes bring (or promise) a number of benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>The compiled stylesheet is significantly smaller, important when a number of compiled stylesheets are
cached in a web server.</li>
<li>It is possible to distribute a stylesheet in scrambled form, so that users cannot easily make changes.</li>
<li>Unused parts of the stylesheet, for example template rules in imported modules, are discarded.</li>
<li>The compiled stylesheet is relocatable between servers (e.g. under EJB).</li>
<li>Stylesheet optimizations, by rewriting the tree, become feasible. Until now the Saxon optimizer has
only operated at the level of individual XPath expressions. A few simple optimizations have been implemented
in this release, e.g. the decision whether to execute <code>xsl:fallback</code> is made entirely
at compile-time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The main drawback is that less of the static context is available during execution. This makes a number of
things more difficult, or in some cases impossible:</p>

<ul>
<li>Diagnostics, such as tracing and debugging, have less information available. For example, variable names
are currently not retained in the executable.</li>
<li>Reflexive capabilities become more difficult. The obvious examples are <code>saxon:evaluate</code> and
the <code>saxon:allow-avt</code> attribute which allows dyanamic selection of a template in <code>xsl:call-template</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In general I expect that stylesheets will need to be recompiled whenever a new Saxon version is issued,
though this may be avoidable the case of a bug-clearance release.</p>

<p><i>Stylesheet compilation is a little fragile at this release. It has proved difficult to test it
comprehensively. One known restriction is that stylesheets containing <code>saxon:collation</code> declarations
cannot be compiled (because it uses Java classes that are not serializable). There may be other restrictions:
please let me know if you find any.</i></p>

<p>As part of this change, the stylesheet tree now uses a different NamePool from the source tree. This
NamePool is discarded as soon as compilation is complete. Names
used in XPath expressions, names of literal result elements and attributes, and names of keys, variables,
templates, and functions, are still registered in the NamePool for the source document, but the names
of XSLT elements and attributes (e.g. <code>xsl:template</code>, <code>select</code>) no longer appear.
This significantly reduces the size of the compiled version of a small stylesheet, and makes loading
of the compiled stylesheet correspondingly faster. It also means that names used in the source document
are less likely to encounter hashing conflicts in the NamePool, giving a small run-time speed-up.</p>

<p>There have been a number of changes to APIs that may affect users.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <code>XSLTContext</code> object has been merged into <code>net.sf.saxon.Controller</code>. This
class was exposed in the traditional Saxon Java event-handling API, and was also available for use
by extension functions, extension elements, and trace listeners. Extension functions that require
context information must now declare a first argument of class <code>XPathContext</code>.</li>

<li>The tracing API has changed, as the execution flow
can no longer be described in terms of nodes in the stylesheet tree. Since it had to change anyway, I have
taken the opportunity to redesign it in terms of interfaces that hopefully will stand the test of time.</li>

<li>The element extensibility API is changed
because extension elements, like other nodes in the stylesheet, must be compiled into separate data structure
for execution. The ExtensionElementFactory interface is unaffected, but the classes implementing individual
instructions must be split in two: a subclass of StyleElement representing the node on the stylesheet
tree, which contains a compile() method, which in turn generates a corresponding instance of a subtype
of the class <code>net.sf.saxon.instruct.Instruction</code>. The SQL extension library has been
updated to show how the new scheme works.</li>

<li>The NodeHandler interface (used by the old "non-XSLT" Java interface to Saxon) has changed again.
Its start() method is replaced by a process() method that takes a single argument, the Controller object.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Internal Changes</h3>

<h4>Emitter and Receiver classes</h4>

<p>I have introduced a new interface, <code>net.sf.saxon.event.Receiver</code>, which is intended to
replace the old <code>Emitter</code> interface. This supports setting type
annotations on element and attribute nodes: it allows the type information to be carried with the
element and attribute events, and also allows various properties to be associated with each event, used
for disable-output-escaping and to indicate when validation has already been done so it does not get
done twice.</p>

<p>The classes that implement this interface are largely in package <code>net.sf.saxon.event</code>, which
replaces the old <code>net.sf.saxon.output</code> package.</p> 

<p>The new interface largely replaces the Outputter interface, ending the artificial
distinction between the Outputter and the Emitter, which was there historically because events were
handled in a different order at the two interfaces.</p>

<p>The "sticky d-o-e" facility is not working in this release: that is, an error is reported
when output is written to a temporary tree with disable-output-escaping="yes". The same happens
if the final output of the stylesheet is written to a Saxon tree, for example when using a Saxon-created
DOMResult, or when using stylesheet chaining. It is possible that "sticky d-o-e" will not be
allowed in the final XSLT 2.0 specification, though at present there are open issues concerning this.
{outp09, bug17}</p>

<h4>Internal XPath Changes</h4>

<p>The class hierarchy for XPath expressions (net.sf.saxon.expr.Expression) has been simplified. The two
abstract classes SingleValueExpression and SequenceExpression have disappeared; their functionality has
moved into the parent class, Expression, driven by the static cardinality of the expression as determined
by the getCardinality() method. This allows greater re-use of classes such as BinaryExpression. There is
potential for many expressions to be implemented as functions, allowing more use of generic code and
table-driven static analysis.</p>

<p>The implementation of SequenceExpressions of the form <code>(1,2,3)</code> has changed completely,
and is much simpler.
They are now handled by breaking them up into a tree of binary expressions, treating "," as a list
concatenation operator. {expr53, 54, 55, 86}</p>

<p>The implementation of FilterExpressions has been rewritten and simplified. Two different iterators
are now used, a FilterIterator where every value needs to be tested, and a PositionIterator where
the value is known statically to be numeric. This greatly simplifies the code. The way in which reverse
axes are handled has also been simplified.</p>

<p><i>I want to move away from run-time expression reduction on filters to doing a static
rewrite that pulls non-dependent subexpressions out of the predicate, but this has not yet been done.</i></p>

<p>The class <code>XPathException</code> is now abstract. There are two concrete subclasses, 
<code>XPathException.Static</code> and <code>XPathException.Dynamic</code>, used to distinguish static
from dynamic errors. (Other subtypes, for example <code>XPathException.TypeError</code> may be
introduced in future. A dynamic error that occurs when an XPath expression is evaluated early (at
compile time) is now not reported until run-time, and is only reported if the expression is actually
evaluated.</p>


<h3>Other changes</h3>

<p>I have decided to drop the integration with Apache's FOP processor. The API has changed yet
again between FOP 0.20.3 and FOP 0.20.4. It is simply too much hassle to keep chasing a moving
target, especially as the changes are not well documented and impossible to make without studying
the FOP source code.</p>

<p>It is now possible to control the use of NamePools via the TransformerFactory. The call
<code>factory.setAttribute(FeatureKeys.NAME_POOL, pool)</code> causes the specified namepool
to be used by all stylesheets that are compiled (using <code>newTemplates()</code>) following 
this call. Note: unless you really know what you are doing, it is safest to let Saxon manage
the namePools automatically.</p>

<p>The HTML output method now uses its own internal method for URI escaping, rather than relying on the
utf8 encoding available in the Java IO library. {outp52, 57}</p>

<p>Support for SAX1 XML parsers is withdrawn. All mainstream parsers support SAX2, with the possible
exception of James Clark's xp. Similarly, output will no longer be directed to a SAX1 DocumentHandler:
you must supply a SAX2 ContentHandler instead. Saxon now compiles without any deprecation warnings.</p>

<hr/>

<H2>Changes in version 7.2 (2002-08-28) </H2>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<div style="border: solid thin; background-color: lime; padding: 1em">
<p>Saxon 7.2 requires Java JDK 1.4</p>
</div>

<p>Saxon 7.2 requires JDK 1.4. This is primarily to support the use of regular expressions: Saxon now uses
the JDK 1.4 regular expression library to support <code>xsl:analyze-string</code> and the functions
<code>matches()</code>, <code>replace()</code>, and <code>tokenize()</code>.</p>

<p>Since JDK 1.4 includes an XML parser, there is no longer any good reason for Saxon to supply its own
XML parser. Therefore AElfred is no longer included in the Saxon package, and the default will be to use
the Crimson parser (or whatever is included in the JDK 1.4 distribution).</p>

<p><i>Note: JDK 1.4 appears to require more [or allocate less] stack space than JDK 1.3, some 
transformations that ran successfully in JDK 1.3 run out of stack space with JDK 1.4. This equally
affects earlier Saxon releases when running with JDK 1.4</i></p>

<h3>XSLT changes</h3>

<p>Implemented the <code>xsl:analyze-string</code> instruction, which supports regular expression
matching.</p>

<p>Where an embedded expression within an attribute value template yields a sequence of more than one
item, the string values of all the items are now output, separated by spaces. <b>This is incompatible
with XSLT 1.0, which ignored all but the first node in a node-set.</b> If this causes compatibility
problems (a) you can fix it by using the filter <code>[1]</code> after the expression, (b) please
let me know: the XSL WG wants to know whether this incompatible change is likely to cause problems
in practice.</p>

<p>The elements <code>xsl:variable</code>, <code>xsl:param</code>, and <code>xsl:result</code> may
now take a <code>type</code> attribute indicating the required type of the value. The supplied value
will be converted to this type if necessary. The value of the attribute is the same subset of the
XPath SequenceType production as is implemented for "cast as" and "instance of" expressions: basically,
the fixed types such as "item" and "element" and the built-in types such as xs:string and xs:date, followed
by an optional occurrence indicator.

<p>Parameters to <code>xsl:function</code> may no longer specify a default value: all arguments
must be supplied in the function call.</p>
<p>An <code>xsl:message</code> instruction may now appear inside an <code>xsl:function</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>xsl:text</code> instruction may now contain other instructions, such as <code>xsl:value-of</code>.
<i>Pending resolution of issue 132 in the spec, avoid using disable-output-escaping with nested xsl:text
elements. The effect is unlikely to be what you expected.</i>.</p>

<p>It is now an error to specify the <code>mode</code> or <code>priority</code> attributes on an
<code>xsl:template</code> element with no <code>match</code> attribute.</p>

<p>Match patterns using the <code>id()</code> and <code>key()</code> functions can now reference global
variables or parameters for the value of the id or key.</p>

<p>The attributes <code>version</code>, <code>exclude-result-prefixes</code>, and <code>extension-element-prefixes</code>
may now appear on any element in the XSLT namespace. Note that these attributes are prefixed <code>xsl:</code>
when used on a literal result element, but have no prefix when used on an XSLT element.</p>

<p>The attribute <code>[xsl:]default-xpath-namespace</code> is now available on all elements. It defines the defualt
namespace to be used for unprefixed element names in path expressions and patterns.</p>

<p>The <code>xsl:apply-templates</code> element now allows <code>mode="#current"</code> and
<code>mode="#default"</code>. The <code>xsl:template</code> allows the <code>mode</code> attribute
to be a list of mode names, optionally including <code>#default</code> to match the default mode.</p>

<p>The <code>disable-output-escaping</code> attribute of <code>xsl:attribute</code> is implemented, replacing
the <code>saxon:disable-output-escaping</code> extension, which is no longer available.</p>

<p>The <code>xsl:destination</code> element is renamed <code>xsl:principal-result-document</code>. (This was
misdocumented in version 7.1).</p>

<p>Implemented the <code>unparsed-text()</code> function (with the second argument being mandatory).</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>Added a -v option to the command line to request XML validation. This applies to the principal source
document and other files read using the document() function. It requires an XML parser 
that supports validation.</p>

<p>The same feature is available in the API using <code>setFeature(FeatureKeys.VALIDATION, Boolean.TRUE)</code>
on the <code>TransformerFactory</code>.</p>

<p>Added a <code>getTransformer()</code> method to the <code>net.sf.saxon.Filter</code> class that is
created in response to <code>SAXTransformerFactory#newXMLFilter()</code>. This allows setting of stylesheet
parameters, a URIResolver, etc, when using this interface. Not tested.</p>

<p>The standard TraceListener now outputs an abbreviated version of the file name of the stylesheet module
containing an instruction, as well as the line number.</p>

<p>The indentation algorithm for method="xml" has been changed so no extra whitespace is output if there
is already enough whitespace in the result tree: specifically, if a start tag is preceded by a newline and
as many spaces as the indentation would output, then no extra indentation takes place. The effect is to avoid
adding blank lines when copying XML that is already indented. This change does not affect method="html",
because the HTML indentation rules are more complex and can easily affect the appearance of text in the
browser if applied wrongly.</p>


<h3>XPath changes</h3>

<p>Implemented the regular expression functions matches(), replace() and tokenize() as defined
in the <i>Functions and Operators</i> specification;
also the regex-group() function defined in the XSLT 2.0 WD.
</p>

<p>The <code>only</code> option in the construct <code>A instance of [only] B</code> has been
removed, as it is no longer defined in the XPath WD.</p>

<p>Changed the rules for the context document: this is now always the document containing
the context node. If the context item is not a node, there is no context document, and any
absolute path expression (or calls on id(), key(), or unparsed-entity-uri()) will cause a
dynamic error.</p>

<p>Implemented the <code>time</code> data type, the constructor xs:time(),
 and the functions current-date() and current-time(). Time values can be compared for equality or
 ordering, and can be sorted.</p>
 
<p>Implemented the component extraction functions, get-x-from-y, for date, dateTime, and time.</p>

<p>Changed DateTime and time classes so that the timezone is retained as part of the value. Equality
and ordering is done by normalizing the time to UTC, but conversion to a string, and extraction of
components, reflects the timezone as originally specified.<p>

<p>Constructor functions such as dateTime() have been moved to the schema namespace (you can use either
"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" (conventional prefix xs) or "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes"
(conventional prefix xsd). Stylesheets that use these constructor functions must be changed. The 
semantics of these constructor are identical to the cast expression.</p> 

<p>Added the duration data-type, including conversion to and from strings, comparison for equality and
ordering, sorting, and component extraction. (This goes beyond the XPath 2.0 drafts, which do not allow
ordering on durations.) Ordering is based on the average length of a month (one
year = 365.25... days): so <code>P365D &lt; P1Y</code> and <code>P366D &gt; P1Y</code>.
 Component extraction works on any kind of duration, and the functions are currently
named get-X-from-duration(), not get-X-from-yearMonthDuration() or get-X-from-dayTimeDuration().
Arithmetic involving durations or dates is not yet implemented.</p>

<p>Added the two XPath-defined subtypes of duration: xs:dayTimeDuration and xs:yearMonthDuration. 
Implemented the functions to construct these from a number of months or seconds. The "+" and "-" 
operators can be used to add two durations of the same type, and the "*" and "div" operators to
multiply or divide a duration by a number.</p>

<p>Added the subtypes of xs:integer (xs:long, xs:int, xs:short and the rest). The type promotion
rules for comparison and arithmetic on numeric types have been brought into line with the specification,
though there are probably still a few minor discrepancies (especially where fallback conversions
from strings are involved).</p>

<p>Added the <code>idiv</code> operator for integer division. For example, <code>10 idiv 3</code> is 3.
The <code>div</code> operator always returns a double result.</p>

<p>Added the subtypes of xs:string (token, language, Name, NCName, ID, IDREF, ENTITY, NMTOKEN); but not
the list types IDREF, ENTITIES, NMTOKENS. These have no useful functionality beyond the ability to validate
the lexical rules for each type.</p>

<p>Implemented the distinct-nodes() function (at the same time fixing a bug in union, intersect and
except when supplied with arguments that are not in document order).</p>

<p>Implemented the deep-equal() function. 
Because nodes are still untyped, it compares string values of text nodes rather
than typed values. <i>Not yet tested with an explicit collation.</i> </p>

<p>Renamed the sublist() function as subsequence().</p>

<p>Implemented the sequence-node-equal() and sequence-deep-equal() functions. 
<i>Not yet tested with an explicit collation.</i></p>

<p>Implemented the functions node-kind(), root(), context-item().</p>

<p>Added the EXSLT functions in package math: abs, acos, asin, atan, atan2,
constant, cos, exp, log, power, random, sin, sqrt, tan. Thanks to Simon St. Laurent
for these. Only partially tested.</p>

<p>The saxon:intersection and saxon:difference extension functions have been dropped;
instead use either the XPath 2.0 operators (intersect, except) or the EXSLT functions.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>Many internal iterators work with a one-item lookahead. This is wasteful if the iteration is not
continued to completion, which happens for example with a numeric predicate such as expr[1], or
with an existential comparison such as <code>sequenceA = sequenceB</code>, or when converting a
sequence to a string or a boolean. This lookahead has been removed for some commonly used iterations,
notably the FilterIterator, the MappingIterator, and the TinyTree SiblingIterator. 
A consequence is that the hasNext() method of SequenceIterator can now throw an XPathException.</p>

<p>Deferred evaluation of variables happened in the past when the expression was a SequenceExpression.
It now happens only if the compile-time cardinality of the expression allows more than one item. This
means that deferred evaluation will not be used for an expression of the form expr[1]. And when
deferred evaluation is used, the iterator is not primed by calling hasNext(): this means that (for an
iterator that doesn't do lookahead), the search for the first item is now deferred until the variable
is first used, and doesn't have to be repeated unnecessarily. In addition, if the variable is referenced
in a context where only the first item in the sequence is required (e.g. to get the value as a boolean
or as a string), the value is now saved without evaluating the full sequence.</p>

<p>I have added an optimization for constructs of the form <code>&lt;xsl:if test="a | b"&gt;</code>.
Where a union expression is evaluated in a boolean context it is now treated as if the operator were "or".
This potentially avoids the need to sort the two node-sets into document order.</p>

<p>There are some changes in the way global variables are handled. At compile time, a hash table is used
in place of linear searching to search for duplicates: this should improve compilation performance for
stylesheets with many global variables, especially when many of the variables are overridden by an
importing stylesheet. At run-time, evaluation of global variables is now deferred until the first reference
to the variable, which will improve execution performance when there are global variables that are never
referenced. Note that this change will be visible if &lt;xsl:message&gt; is used to trace execution.</p>

<p>A filter expression of the form <code>f[a and b]</code> is now rewritten as <code>f[a][b]</code> when
appropriate, to enable an early exit in the case where <code>a</code> is positional: for example
<code>item[position() = 1 and child::desc]</code>. This is only done if <code>a</code> is positional and
<code>b</code> is not.</p>

<p>A union (or intersection or difference) of two path expressions is now rewritten to do the combination
as late as possible: for example <code> ( /a/b/c | /a/b/d )</code> is rewritten as <code>( /a/b/(c|d) )</code>.
<i>Note, this is a first small step in the identification of common subexpressions. The cases where two
subexpressions are detected as being identical are fairly limited, for example there is no knowledge
of which operators are commutative or associative.</i></p>

<h3>Internal Changes</h3>

<p>The organization of the net.sf.saxon.functions package has changed. Much of the fixed information
associated with individual functions is now contained in a static table in the StandardFunction.java module, rather
than being returned by methods associated with each function. Most of the optimization methods (simplify,
getDependencies, and reduce) now have a generic default implementation in the Function.java class, 
which most of the individual functions now use. This has reduced the overhead associated with implementing
each function, which is important as the number of functions in XPath 2.0 has grown so much. It also creates
further opportunities for combining the implementation of several related functions in one module, with
better ability to share common code.</p>

<p>Unique document numbers are now allocated in the NamePool rather than the DocumentPool. This is
visible in the results of generate-id(), because it means document numbers are not reset at the
beginning of each transformation. This change has been made so that functions that rely on unique
document numbers (for example, comparison of nodes into document order, or the union operation) 
can be done safely in a free-standing XPath environment. Eventually this will also allow
document() to be executed outside an XSLT context - but not yet.</p>

<h3>Integration and Extensions</h3>

<p>I have tested Saxon with the Resin XML parser, but found it very buggy (version 2.1.1)</p>

<p>I have tested Saxon with the Piccolo XML parser (version 1.03), and found it worked very well 
except for a few stress tests, particularly in the area of namespace handling. I have reported four
bugs.</p>

<p>The tables for converting XPath data types to Java types (when calling extension functions) have
been revamped. The design has changed so that where there are two methods that appear to match the
function call, one of them will generally be chosen even if the choice is arbitrary: this is because
in many cases where Java classes define polymorphic methods, the results will be the same whichever
method is chosen.</p>

<hr />

<H2>Changes in version 7.1 (2002-04-30) </H2>

<h3>Integration</h3>

<p>This version of Saxon has been modified and tested to work with JDOM beta 0.8 and with FOP 0.20.3. 
In both cases, code changes were needed to work with these versions, and I have not tested whether the code
still works with earlier versions; the chances are that it doesn't.</p>

<h3>Error clearance</h3>

<p>In general, bugs that have been cleared in Saxon 6.5.1 or Saxon 6.5.2 have also been cleared in this
release. For details of the clearance of specific bugs, see the bug tracker at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=29872&atid=397617">Sourceforge</a>.
Remember that closed bugs are not listed unless you ask for them.</p>

<h3>Multiple output documents</h3>

<p>The <code>href</code> attribute of <code>xsl:result-document</code> is now interpreted as a relative
URI, relative to the system ID of the principal result document. This works only where the system ID of the
principal output is known, and uses the "file://" protocol. The result document is no longer created
 relative to the current working directory, for security reasons (it causes problems when executing
 an untrusted stylesheet in a servlet environment).</p>
 
<p>Note that when Saxon is invoked from the command line, the -o option should be used to specify the 
principal output destination. This will ensure that a suitable system ID is available. If the result document
is sent to the standard output stream (even if this is redirected to a file), Saxon will not know the
system identifier and will therefore be unable to create a secondary output destination using a relative
URI. It is still possible, of course, to specify an absolute URI as the value of the <code>href</code>
attribute - note that this must be a URL, not a filename, so it will typically start with <code>file://</code>.</p>

<p>It is now possible to specify an OutputURIResolver to be used to resolve the URI specified in the <code>href</code>
attribute of the <code>xsl:result-document</code> element. This will be used in place of the standard output URI
resolver. The OutputURIResolver is called when writing of the output document starts, at which point it must
return a JAXP Result object to act as the output destination. It is called again when writing of an output document
is complete. You can nominate an OutputURIResolver by calling 
<code>((Controller)transformer).setOutputURIResolver(new UserOutputResolver())</code>,
or by calling <code>factory.setAttribute("http://saxon.sf.net/feature/outputURIResolver", 
new UserOutputResolver())</code>.</p>

<p>If the -t option is used, a message is written to the standard error output identifying the 
files written using using <code>xsl:result-document</code>.</p> 

<p>It is now an error to use <code>xsl:result-document</code> when the current output destination
is a temporary tree.</p>



<h3>XSLT changes</h3>

<p>The meaning of the ALLOW_EXTENSION_FUNCTIONS attribute in the TransformerFactory has been
extended so that setting the value to <code>false</code> also disables extension elements and
the creation of multiple output files. This is because all these operations carry similar risks
when a servlet is allowed to execute untrusted stylesheets.</p>

<p>Added support for the <code>separator</code> attribute of <code>&lt;xsl:copy-of&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>current()</code> function may now be used in a pattern (specifically, within a predicate).
 Its value is the node being tested against the pattern. For example, <code>match="*[*[name()=name(current())]"</code> 
 matches any element that contains another element with the same name.</p>
 
<p>A global variable or parameter may now be used in the match pattern of <code>xsl:template</code>, provided that it does
not cause a circularity (that is, it must be possible to evaluate the variable without calling
<code>xsl:apply-templates</code>)</p>

<p>A global variable or parameter may now be used in the match pattern or the use expression 
of <code>xsl:key</code>, provided that it does
not cause a circularity (that is, it must be possible to evaluate the variable without using the <code>key()</code>
function against the key being defined)</p>

<p>The <code>key()</code> function may now be used in the <code>use</code> or <code>match</code> attributes of
<code>xsl:key</code>, provided the key definitions are not circular. (For example, key k1 can be defined
in terms of key k2, provided that k2 is not defined in terms of k1.)</p>

<p>The <code>group-ending-with</code> attribute of <code>xsl:for-each-group</code> is implemented. It is especially
useful where the last node in each group carries some kind of marker, for example <code>continued="no"</code>.</p>

<p>Added attribute <code>default="yes"|"no"</code> to <code>saxon:collation</code>, to specify whether this collation
should be used as the default collation. If more than one collation is specified as the default, the last one wins.
If no default collation is specified, Unicode codepoint collation is used. The default collation is used by
the compare() function if no third argument is supplied, by xsl:sort if no collation is specified (for data type text
or string), and also by the comparison operators =, !=, &lt;, &gt;, etc.</p>

<p>The collation name is now a URI, not a QName.</p>

<p>Sorting and comparison according to Unicode codepoints can be achieved by setting up a collator as 
<code>&lt;saxon:collation name="unicode" class="net.sf.saxon.sort.CodepointCollator"/&gt;</code></p>



<h3>XPath changes</h3>

<p>The implementation of the "and" and "or" operators has reverted to two-valued logic, since
three-valued logic didn't make it into the published XPath 2.0 working draft. (Actually, it
seems 3-valued logic wasn't working in Saxon 7.0 anyway).</p>

<p>Changed the "==" and "!==" operators to "is" and "isnot".</p>

<p>Changed string literals to allow the delimiting quote marks to be doubled. For example,
<code>&lt;xsl:value-of select="'[He isn''t]'"/&gt;</code> displays the string <code>[He isn't]</code></p>

<p>Changed the <code>some</code> and <code>every</code> expressions to allow multiple range variables, 
for example <code>some $i in //I, $j in //J satisfies $i = $j</code></p>

<p>Implemented the singleton value-comparison operators (eq, ne, gt, lt, ge, le). These return an error
if applied to a sequence containing more than one item, and return the empty sequence if either operand
is an empty sequence; when applied to singletons, they return the same result as the XPath 1.0 operators
(=, !=, etc).</p>

<p>Less-than and greater-than comparisons between nodes and/or strings now do a lexicographic comparison
using the default collating sequence; at XPath 1.0 they did a numeric comparison. A warning is output in
this situation (and one or two other situations, but not all) to advise of the backwards incompatibility.</p>


<p>The rules for deciding when path expressions need to be sorted have been revised. As a result
many cases now require no sort where previously a sort was done. Examples of such expressions
include a/b/c, .//a, $x[1]/a, //@a. In addition, most path expressions that return results in
reverse document order are now sorted by a simple reversal, which is much faster than a full sort.</p>

<p><b>There's a temporary bug in that path expressions returning namespace nodes don't always return
them in document order. I'm awaiting resolution of the XPath 2.0 data model rules before fixing this.</b></p>



<p>Suppress lazy evaluation of assignable variables. (This was designed to prevent
a stack overflow, it didn't succeed, but it seems a good idea anyway).</p>

<p>Added the ability for a Source object to be supplied as the value of a stylesheet
parameter or as the value returned by an extension function.</p>

<p>Added dateTime and date data types. Initially the only operations supported are the
currentDateTime function, the dateTime and date constructors, and conversion between
strings, dates, and dateTimes in both directions. Conversion to string uses the timezone
of the current locale.</p>

<p>Implemented comparisons (equals, less-than, etc) between dates and dateTimes.
Also implemented sorting. The data-type of xsl:sort may take the two values "text" or "number" 
(which are treated as synonyms of xs:string and xs:double) or any XML Schema built-in data type
for which sorting is supported. The values in the sequence to be sorted are converted to this
data type (using the same rules as for <code>cast as</code>) and the rules for this data type
determine the sort order.</p>

<p>Note that (as required by the XML Schema specification) dateTime values are normalized to UTC.
The original timezone specified when the dateTime was constructed is not retained. If no timezone
is present, this fact <i>is</i> remembered. Such a dateTime is compared with other dateTimes as if
it were a UTC dateTime.</p>


<p>Implemented the <b>instance of</b> operator (including the <b>instance of only</b> variant):
for example <code>if ($x instance of xs:integer *) then x else y</code>. The types that are currently
supported are the 19 primitive schema types (the namespace may be either of the two namespaces
permitted in XML Schema Part 2), the derived type xs:integer, the node types document, element,
attribute, text, comment, processing-instruction, or namespace, and the abstract types node, and item.
(There is no syntax currently for the general numeric type or for the general atomic type). The
type name may be followed by one of the qualifiers "*", "+", or "?" to indicate the number of 
occurrences; if there is no qualifier, there must be exactly one occurrence. The more sophisticated
forms of type-checking, using schema-defined complex types, are not yet supported.</p>

<p>Implemented the <b>cast as data-type</b> expression, for example <code>cast as xs:boolean($x)</code>.
The conversion rules are the same as those which apply implicitly when a value is supplied
in a context where a different type is expected.</p>

<p>Implemented the <b>treat as data-type</b> expression. This doesn't actually have much use in an
XSLT context, where type conversion is performed implicitly when required, and the semantics of the
expression are probably not correctly implemented at this stage: the specification is still evolving.</p> 



<h3>New XPath API</h3>

<p>A new API has been introduced for executing XPath expressions. This is simpler and safer than the
API provided in previous releases, which was essentially improvised from implementation classes rather
than being designed top-down as an interface suitable for application use. The API is loosely modelled
on the proposed DOM Level 3 API for XPath.</p>

<p>The new API uses the class <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath.XPathEvaluator</code>. This class provides a few
simple configuration interfaces to set the source document, the static context, and the context node,
plus a number of methods for evaluating XPath expressions. The static context can be omitted if the
expression does not use namespaces, external variables, or extension functions. If the expression uses
namespaces, an instance of StandaloneContext can be supplied, allowing the required namespaces to be 
declared either explicitly, or by reference to the in-scope namespaces of some Node.</p>

<p>There are two methods for direct evaluation,
evaluate() which returns a List containing the result of the expression (which in general is a sequence),
and evaluateSingle() which returns the first item in the result (this is appropriate where it is known
that the result will be single-valued). The results are returned as NodeInfo objects in the case of nodes,
or as objects of the most appropriate Java class in the case of atomic values: for example, Boolean, Double,
or String in the case of the traditional XPath 1.0 data types.</p>

<p>It is also possible to prepare an XPath expression for subsequent execution, using the createExpression() method
on the XPathEvaluator class. This is worthwhile where the same expression is to be executed repeatedly.
The compiled expression is represented by an instance of the class net.sf.saxon.xpath.XPathExpression,
and it can be executed repeatedly, with different context nodes. However, the compiled expression is bound
to one particular source document (this is to ensure that the same NamePool is used).</p>

<p>The design principle of this API is to minimize the number of Saxon classes that need to be used.
Apart from the NodeInfo interface, which is needed when manipulating Saxon trees, only the four classes
XPathProcessor, XPathExpression, StandaloneContext, and XPathException are needed. 
For convenience, XPathException and StandaloneContext have been moved to the net.sf.saxon.xpath package.</p>

<p>If you want to use extension functions or variables you will need to create your own implementation
of StaticContext. Although this interface has been greatly simplified, this is still not to be attempted lightly.</p>

<p>The old APIs for executing expressions still exist for the time being, but they are likely to
 be less stable.</p>

<h3>Internal changes</h3>

<p>Changed ContentEmitter to check in startElement() that qname and local-name are both supplied;
this checks against parser configuration errors. This change could (should?) be retrofitted to the 6.5 branch.
The change also uses a stack of namecodes so that endElement() doesn't need to look up the names in 
the name pool. In implementing this change, I discovered that Saxon depends on the XML parser passing
the QName argument to the startElement() call, something which according to the SAX2 specification is
optional. However, all known parsers supply this argument, and the code changes to cope with its absence
would damage performance, so I have simply documented this as a dependency on the parser.</p>

<p>Implemented infrastructure for data type support:</p>

<ul>
<li>A new class net.sf.saxon.value.Type centralizes the definition of node types and atomic types</li>
<li>The tokenizer now does single-token lookahead, needed to support double-keywords such as "cast as"</li>
<li>Added parsing support for "EXPR instance of [only] DATATYPE" and "cast as DATATYPE ( EXPR )"</li>
<li>Added isA method to SimpleValue so each value knows what types (primitive or derived) it belongs to</li>
</ul>

<p>I have changed the implementation of temporary trees (result tree fragments). The FragmentValue class
has disapeared. This delayed the construction of an actual tree until it the tree was actually used as
a node-set: the effect was to optimize simple uses of temporary trees but at considerable cost to the more
general usage which is now permitted in XSLT 2.0. Also, the introduction of tinytrees has reduced the
value of this optimization. Therefore, a temporary tree is now constructed immediately as a real tree.</p>

<p>A side-effect of this change is that when disable-output-escaping is used while writing nodes to a
tree, the instructions to switch escaping on and off are recorded in the tree in the form of the
processing instructions defined by JAXP 1.1. Previously, these instructions were recorded in a form that
kept the information through an xsl:copy-of instruction, but lost the information if the tree was processed
in any other way. Note that the behavior of "sticky d-o-e" (that is, the effect of disabling output
escaping when writing to a temporary tree) is currently an open issue in XSLT 2.0.</p>

<p>The indexes associated with keys are no longer referenced from each document instance, they are
handled externally. This makes it easier to share the same index implementation across all the different
document implementations. The indexes are now held by the KeyManager. It uses a WeakHashMap to ensure
that when a document is removed from memory by the garbage collector, its indexes are removed too.</p>

<p>The mechanism for keeping stylesheet signatures in the namepool has been removed. It caused
a creeping "memory leak" in continuously running services, and is not really needed. It was invented
to allow namepools to be copied, but this facility has never been properly documented or tested.
Instead, there is now a simple check that the source document and stylesheet are using the same
namepool. (This change, or a simplified version of it, has also been made to 6.5.2).</p>

<p>The StaticContext interface has been greatly simplified, reducing duplication and making it easier to
create a new implementation of this interface. This has been achieved partly by doing some work in the 
XPath ExpressionParser that was previously done in the StaticContext, and partly by changing those functions
such as format-number() and sort() that only work in an XSLT context to check that the context is indeed
XSLT before accessing the context information.</p> 

<h3>SQL extension</h3>

<p>At the suggestion of Claudio Thomas [claudio.thomas@web.de], I have extended the <b>sql:query</b> instruction
to allow the attribute <code>disable-output-escaping="yes|no"</code>. This is useful where the database
content being retrieved contains XML or HTML markup that is to be preserved in the output. Use this
with care; it disables escaping for all the rows and columns retrieved, some of which may contain
special characters such as "&lt;" and "&amp;" that do need to be escaped.</p>

<p><i>This change has not been tested.</i></p> 

<h3>Extension functions</h3>

<p>Added extension functions: <a href="extensions.html#parse">saxon:parse()</a> and
<a href="extensions.html#serialize">saxon:serialize()</a>. These allow conversion of a string containing
well-formed XML to a tree structure, and vice-versa.</p>

<p>Added extension functions: <a href="extensions.html#string-to-unicode">saxon:string-to-unicode()</a> and
<a href="extensions.html#unicode-to-string">saxon:unicode-to-string()</a>. These allow conversion between a string and
a sequence of integers representing the Unicode values of the characters in the string.</p>

<p>Added extension functions <a href="extensions.html#pause-tracing">saxon:pause-tracing()</a>
 and <a href="extensions.html#resume-tracing">saxon:resume-tracing()</a>.</p>

<p>The return value from an extension function may now be an implementation of <code>java.util.List</code>,
representing a sequence. The members of the <code>List</code> must all implement <code>net.sf.saxon.om.Item</code></li>

<p>An argument to an extension function may now be the class <code>net.sf.saxon.om.NodeInfo</code>, or
a subclass. If the supplied value is a sequence, the first node in the sequence is passed to the function;
it is an error if there is no node in the supplied sequence, or if the node is of the wrong type.</p>

<p>The rules for calling extension functions with a sequence-valued argument have been clarified, and
some new options are permitted, e.g. declaring the argument as <code>java.util.List</code>. The possibilities
have not been extensively tested.</p>

<p>Implemented memo functions (thanks to Robert Brotherus for the suggestion).
If you specify the attribute <code>saxon:memo-function="yes"</code> on <code>xsl:function</code>,
Saxon will keep a cache that maps the supplied argument values to the result of the
function, and if the function is called twice with the same arguments, the original
result will be returned without re-evaluating the function. Don't use this option on a function
that depends on the context, or on a function that creates a new temporary tree and
is required to create a new instance each time. Also note that there are cases where it
may be faster to re-evaluate the function than to do the lookup; this is especially true
if the argument is a large node-set.</p>

<hr/>

<H2>Changes in version 7.0 (2001-12-20) </H2>

<p>This version introduces initial support of features defined
 in working drafts of XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0.<p>
 
<p><b>Version 7.0 should be regarded as an experimental alpha release. For production
use, please continue to use <a href="http://saxon.sf.net/saxon6.5/">Saxon 6.5</a></b></p>
 
<p>The Saxon package name has changed from <b>com.icl.saxon</b> to <b>net.sf.saxon</b>.
Any applications that use Saxon java classes directly (rather than relying on the JAXP
interface) will need to be modified. Note that this also affects the settings of the system
properties <code>javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory</code> and
 <code>javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory</code>.</p>

<p>The entry point from the command line has changed from <b>com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet</b>
to <b>net.sf.saxon.Transform</b>.

<p>The namespace URI for saxon extensions has changed from <b>http://icl.com/saxon</b>
to <b>http://saxon.sf.net/</b>. Note that many extensions have been withdrawn, as they
are superseded by facilities in XPath 2.0 and/or XSLT 2.0.</p>

<p>To allow coexistence, the name of the JAR file for this release has changed to
<code>saxon7.jar</code>. The SQL extensions are now in a separate JAR file, <code>saxon7-sql.jar</code>.
A transformation can now be executed directly from the JAR file using the command
<code>java -jar saxon7.jar</code> in place of <code>java net.sf.saxon.Transform</code>.</p> 

<p>Saxon now requires JDK 1.2 or later to run. In consequence, Saxon will no longer work
with the Microsoft Java VM, and the Instant Saxon version of the product is therefore
no longer available.</p>

<p>Because Saxon no longer runs with the Java VM, it can now be run as an applet within
Internet Explorer only if the Sun Java plug-in is installed. You can get this from
 <a href="http://java.sun.com/getjava">http://java.sun.com/getjava</a>. This may require
 some configuration changes because of the differences in security policy.</p>
 
<p>The following sections summarize the main new features. These assume familiarity with
the XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 specifications; however, summaries of the new syntax for
 <a href="expressions.html">expressions</a> and <a href="xsl-elements.html">XSLT elements</a>
 are included in this package.</p>

<h3>XPath 2.0 Data Model and Language</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sequences of nodes or simple values are supported, 
including the sequence constructor expression <code>($a, $b, $c)</code>.
Path expressions now return a sequence of nodes containing no duplicates, in document
order.</li>
<li>The new <b>if</b> expressions, <b>for</b> expressions, <b>some</b> and <b>every</b>
expressions are supported.</li>
<li>New operators are implemented: <b>except</b>, <b>intersect</b> and </b>union</b> for
combining sequences (implemented only for sequences of nodes at this release); 
also <b>==</b>, <b>!==</b> for comparing node identity, and <b>&lt;&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;&gt;</b>
for comparing relative position of nodes in document order. These
return () when an operand is (), and fail when an operand contains more than
one node.</li>

<li>Any expression may now appear on the right-hand side of the "/" operator (a run-time error
is reported if it doesn't evaluate to a sequence of nodes). Examples: <code>a/(b|c)/d</code>, 
or <code>document('x')/key('a','b')</code></li>

<li>Added range expressions. For example <code>1 to 10</code> evaluates to the
sequence <code>( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 )</code></li>

<li>The new numeric data types integer, decimal, and float are implemented.
XPath literals, and string-to-number conversion, now allow "e" in a numeric literal. 
A literal containing an "e" is
interpreted as a double, any other literal containing a "." is interpreted as a
decimal, and any other numeric literal as an integer. Integers are limited
to 64-bit quantities, but decimals are of unlimited size. Arithmetic is now done 
using the XPath 2.0 type promotion rules,
except that "div" and "mod" always convert both arguments to double. For the
time being, I have retained the XPath 1.0 rule that the string representation
of a number never ends in ".0"; I found that changing it to use the canonical
representation defined in XML Schema (as required by XPath 2.0) meant rewriting too many
of my tests. However, negative zero now converts to the string "-0" (it was "0" 
at XPath 1.0).</li>


<li>The code for equals, not-equals, etc, has been generalized to work on any sequence
 in the same
way as for a node-set. This retains the "existential" semantics of XPath 1.0. It
still does a comparison of the string-value of each item, not the typed value.</li>

<li>Filter expressions now work on any sequence (including a singleton sequence, so 2[1] is
allowed)</li>

<li>3-valued logic has been implemented for AND and OR. 
(This doesn't reflect the XPath 2.0 working draft as published: a late change was made).</li>

<li>The syntax <code>*:localname</code> (like prefix:*) is allowed in path expressions, and also
in patterns and in <code>xsl:strip-space</code> and </code>xsl:preserve-space</code>. It matches
any node with the given local name, regardless of namespace.</li>

<li>The Context object has been changed so that there is
a context item rather than a context node. The context item is either a simple value or
a node. The expression "." returns the value of the context item. If the context item
is not a node, then relative path expression (including self::node()) return an empty
node-set. Absolute path expressions (starting with "/"), and key() and id(), now apply
to the document containing the <b>current</b> node, as distinct from the context node.
<i>Note: the implementation of context document doesn't accurately reflect the concept
 of the context document in the XPath 2.0 working draft as published.
</i></li>

<li>The rules for string-to-boolean conversion have changed so that "", "0" and "false" 
now return false, all other strings return true.</li>



</ul>

<h3>XSLT 2.0 features</h3>

<ul>
<li>The <code>xsl:value-of</code> element has a new <code>separator</code> attribute, so it can
be used to output a sequence.</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:for-each</code> element supports arbitrary sequences.</li>
<li>The extension elements <code>saxon:group</code> and <code>saxon:item</code> are
withdrawn.</li>
<li>The new <code>xsl:for-each-group</code> instruction, and the associated <code>current-group()</code>
function, are implemented.</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:function</code> and <code>xsl:result</code> elements are implemented;
these replace <code>saxon:function</code> and <code>exslt:function</code>.
Note that the XSLT 2.0 specification is more restrictive as to what can appear in a function
body: it has to be zero or more <code>xsl:param</code> elements, followed by zero or more
<code>xsl:variable</code> elements, followed by an <code>xsl:result</code> element.
However, this is not a serious restriction in practice, because most computations can now
be carried out within a single XPath expression.</li>
<li>The new <code>xsl:namespace</code> instruction is implemented (it writes a 
namespace node to the result tree)</li
<li>The <code>xsl:copy-of</code> can now handle sequences containing simple-values
(the simple value is converted to a string and written to the result tree).
However, the <code>separator</code> attribute is not yet implemented.</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:document</code> element (and its synonym <code>saxon:output</code>)
are replaced by <code>xsl:result-document</code>. This no longer includes the serialization
attributes directly, instead it refers by name to an <code>xsl:output</code> declaration,
or can use the unnamed <code>xsl:output</code> declaration by default.</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:output</code> element now supports <code>method="xhtml"</code>,
replacing <code>method="saxon:xhtml"</code>. The precise details of the output may not be fully
conformant with the specification.</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:destination</code> element is provided, however, since the <code>href</code>
attribute is currently ignored, it is not very useful at this stage.</li>
<li>The <code>saxon:handler</code> element is no longer supported.</li>
<li>The <code>xsl:script</code> element is no longer supported - however,
the synonym <code>saxon:script</code> remains available</li>
<li>A <code>collation</code> attribute has been added to <code>xsl:sort</code>, 
and the implementation of sorting now uses JDK 1.2 collators. The <code>collation</code> 
attribute must match the name attribute of a <code>saxon:collation</code> element.
If none is specified, the <code>lang</code> attribute is now used to select a collator, or if the
<code>lang</code> attribute is omitted, a collator is obtained for the default locale. </li>
<li>Named sort keys are available, via the <code>xsl:sort-key</code> element. A named
sort key may be used to perform a sort from within an XPath expression, using the new
XSLT-defined <code>sort()</code> function.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Function Library</h3>

<p>I have made the following changes to the function library:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>saxon:distinct()</code> extension function now works on any sequence.</li>
<li>The <code>count()</code> and <code>sum()</code> functions now ork on any sequence, 
and new functions <code>avg()</code>, <code>min()</code>, and <code>max()</code> are provided.</li>
<li>Added <code>ends-with()</code></li>
<li>Added <code>upper-case()</code> and <code>lower-case()</code>. 
These use the rules defined by the Java default locale</li>
<li>Added properties "product-name" and "product-version" to <code>system-property()</code></li>
<li>Removed the <code>saxon:range()</code> extension function 
(it can now be done using the syntax "a to b")</li>
<li>Changed <code>saxon:tokenize()</code> to return a sequence of strings instead of a node-set</li>
<li>Changed <code>key()</code> so that the second argument can be any sequence; 
each member of the
sequence is converted to a string and treated as a potential key value</li>
<li>Changed <code>document()</code> so that the first argument can be any sequence; each member of
the sequence can be a URI of a document to be loaded.</li>
<li>Removed the <code>saxon:node-set()</code> extension function, which is now obsolete.</li>
<li>Removed the <code>saxon:if()</code> extension function, which is superseded by XPath 2.0 
conditional expressions.</li>
<li>The <code>saxon:closure()</code> function is temporarily withdrawn, because it relies on non-standard
use of the <code>current()</code> function.</li>
<li>The <code>node-set()</code> function in the EXSLT common module is now a no-op; the object-type()
function returns one of "sequence", "boolean", "number", "string", or "external".</li>
<li>Changed <code>highest()</code> and <code>lowest()</code> in the EXSLT <code>math</code> 
module to work on arbitrary sequences.</li>
<li>Added <code>exists()</code> and <code>empty()</code>, 
<code>insert()</code> and <code>remove()</code>, 
<code>index-of()</code> and <code>sublist()</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code>not3()</code> (three-valued not() function)</li>
<li>Added <code>string-pad()</code> function</li>
<li>Removed <code>saxon:exists()</code> and <code>saxon:for-all()</code>: 
these are superseded by the <code>some</code> and <code>every</code>
constructs in XPath 2.0</li>
<li>Added the <code>compare()</code> function: the third argument (collation) is initially mandatory, and must
be a QName matching a <code>saxon:collation</code> element</li>
<li>Added <code>base-uri()</code> function replacing the undocumented
 <code>saxon:base-uri()</code> extension function</li>
<li>Added constructor functions as described in the XPath Functions and Operators specification: 
some of them don't do much yet, but <code>float()</code> is the only way of creating a single-precision
floating point number.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Significant Omissions</h3>

<p>In general, features of XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0 not listed above have not been implemented.
In particular, these include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Backwards compatibility mode in XSLT</li>

<li>The <code>type</code> attribute of <code>xsl:variable</code>, etc.</li>

<li>Uniform handling of the empty sequence by functions and operators in XPath expressions</li>

<li>XPath constructs related to types, for example <code>instance of</code> and
 <code>cast as</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Internal changes</h3>

<p>As might be expected, the Saxon code has undergone major change internally, which
will affect any application making significant use of internal interfaces. Here are
some of the highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>The NodeEnumeration class is replaced with <b>SequenceIterator</b>. 
This is modelled on the JDK 1.2
Iterator interface, and can return any sequence of Items. An Item is either
a SimpleValue or a NodeInfo.</li>

<li>Added the <b>getAnother()</b> method to the SequenceIterator interface. This means all 
SequenceIterators can clone themselves to produce another SequenceIterator of the same
nodes. (But it's not a pure Java clone, because the new iterator is positioned at the
start of the sequence.) The implementation of <b>last()</b> has changed: 
if the SequenceIterator doesn't know
how many nodes there are in the sequence, the iterator is cloned and the items are counted,
without being saved in memory as previously. This should only happen once for any given
iterator, so in general calling last() causes a node-set to be scanned twice.</li>

<li>The <b>Step</b> class has been removed. A step that is a simple unfiltered
axis expression is now represented by an AxisExpression; a step with filters is 
represented by a FilterExpression, and any other kind of expression may also now be 
used in a PathExpression.</li>

<li>An important new internal class is the <b>MappingIterator</b>. This maps one sequence to
another sequence by invoking a MapppingFunction on each member of the first sequence.
This capability is now used to implement both path expressions and <code>for</code>
expressions. It is also used in various other contexts, e.g. in the implementation of
the document(), key() and id() functions.</li>

<li>The <b>asString</b> method on Value is renamed <code>getStringValue</code>,
this allows both SimpleValues and Nodes to implement the new Item interface, which
represents a member of a sequence.</li>

<li>Internal changes in support of datatypes: I removed evaluateAsDouble(), etc,
 and replaced them with a generic method 
<b>evaluate(context, requiredType)</b>, which always returns a Value. A new
package, <code>net.sf.saxon.value</code>, now contains all the data-type related classes. </li>


<li>The functions key(), id(), and document() are now fully pipelined, that is, they deliver an
iterator over the result nodes.</li>

<li>The classes that handle sorting have been totally rewritten, partly to handle general
sequences, and partly to use collations.</li>

<li>The <b>Context</b> class has changed. There are now two separate classes,
XSLTContext and XPathContext. There is only one XSLTContext object used during a transformation
(the information could have been held in the Controller itself). Stacking of values
in the XSLT context uses the Java program execution stack, in the sense that any routine
that sets a new value has to remember the old value and reset it on completion. The
XPath context, by contrast, still creates a new instance every time a new value is stacked.
This essentially just wraps the SequenceIterator that represents the context node list.
The SequenceIterator itself is responsible for returning current item and current
position.</li>

</ul>

<p>I have removed documentation of the <b>saxon:trace</b> extension attribute; 
it seems this hasn't been working for some time.</p>

<h3>API changes</h3>

<ul>

<li>The <code>Context</code> class no longer implements the XSLT 1.1 WD interface
org.w3c.xsl.XSLTContext.</li> 

<li>Dropped the classes in <code>com.icl.saxon.handlers</code> (ElementHandler etc). It is still
possible for a Java application to register a NodeHandler to receive events; this
must now be written as an implementation of the net.sf.saxon.NodeHandler interface.
See the <b>ShowBooks.java</b> sample application to see how.</li>

<li>It is no longer possible to specify a user-defined collation using the <code>data-type</code>
or <code>lang</code> attribute of xsl:sort; instead, it must be specified using the 
<code>collation</code> attribute,
with a <code>saxon:collation</code> element that maps the named collation to a Java
class that implements the JDK <code>java.util.Comparator</code> interface.</li>

</ul>

<h3>SQL extension elements</h3>

<p>A new <code>sql:query</code> instruction has been added, to accompany the
 existing <code>sql:connect</code>, <code>sql:insert</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Attributes:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top">table</td>
<td>The table to be queried (the contents of the FROM clause of the select statement).
This is mandatory, the value is an attribute value template.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">column</td>
<td>The columns to be retrieved (the contents of the SELECT clause of the select statement).
May be "*" to retrieve all columns. This is mandatory, the value is an attribute value template.</td></tr>  
<tr><td valign="top">where</td>
<td>The conditions to be applied (the contents of the WHERE clause of the select statement).
This is optional, if present the value is an attribute value template.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">row-tag</td>
<td>The element name to be used to contain each row. Must be a simple name (no colon
allowed). Default is "row".</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">column-tag</td>
<td>The element name to be used to contain each column. Must be a simple name (no colon
allowed). Default is "col".</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The <code>xsl:query</code> instruction writes zero or more row elements to the current
result tree, each containing zero or more column elements, which contain the data values.</p>

<p>Thanks to Claudio Thomas [claudio.thomas@web.de] who supplied the original version
of this code.</p>

<p>The SQL extensions are now contained in a separate JAR file, <code>saxon7-sql.jar</code>,
which must be on the class path if these extensions are used.</p>
